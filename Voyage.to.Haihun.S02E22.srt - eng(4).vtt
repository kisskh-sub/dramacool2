=Episode 22=

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.510
Scalp Wang,

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.000
you and the brothers stay in the city

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.400
to protect the people

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.350
and the Marquis.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.310
Wang.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.390
Let me go with you

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.760
to avenge my brother.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.000
I need you

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.200
to protect the people now.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.680
Tell me. What's the plan?

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.070
I don't have a plan at all.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.740
Let's just wait for the good news.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.560
From what I know about you,

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.680
you'd never let Wang risk his life.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.900
Seems

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.240
like I can't hide anything from you.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.230
That's only because I know you well.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.400
So, I'm worried.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.000
I won't let you take risks, either.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.320
This time,

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.000
you have to listen to me.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.240
Stay put.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.250
Stay alive.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.310
Once I've decided,

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.620
who could ever change my mind?

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.360
After all these years,

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.430
don't you know me by now?

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.470
Marquis, here are the clothes
you requested.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.400
They were worn for 27 days

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.580
and kept away for over a decade,

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.590
yet they're still as good as new.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.960
Help me change clothes.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:45.710
This way,

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.840
we'll have two chances.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.450
All the antidote has been given out.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.190
Make it like mine.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.260
Let go of your hand.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.870
What does this mean?

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.290
At this very moment,

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.710
what do you think?

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.520
We stand together?

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.560
When two people open their hearts,

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.680
they think alike

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.490
and act in perfect accord.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.690
Let's go.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:48.560
Yes.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.400
I'll wear the dragon robe
and pose as His Majesty

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.980
to draw Li Nvxu's attention.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.240
They'll surely chase after me.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.960
Heng can use this chance
to save the people.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.410
(Yuzhang)
Where will you lead them?

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:11.560
The mausoleum.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.250
Once the gate is sealed,

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.440
they won't be able
to come out anytime soon.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:21.720
I'll give you a ride.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.760
No.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.680
We've been together since childhood,

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.040
so let's stay together forever.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.540
(Yuzhang)

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.840
His Majesty has invited Li Nvxu,
a heroine of Xiqiang,

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.180
to discuss matters in person.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.390
Where is the decree?

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.030
Hyah!

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.790
Hyah! Hyah!

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:55.670
Alright.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.440
Hyah!

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.840
His Majesty has invited Li Nvxu

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.100
to discuss the border troubles
in person.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.070
Enough talk.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.720
Let him come and issue the decree.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.390
Or I'll kill them.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.240
Hold on.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.390
If your heart is set
on protecting your clan,

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.920
why not take this chance

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.800
to speak openly with His Majesty

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.230
and perhaps secure lasting peace
for your people?

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.390
Speak openly?

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.100
He hasn't even shown his face.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.770
His Majesty is our sovereign.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.420
How could he appear so casually?

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.910
Besides,

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.790
this place is full of your men.

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.050
What if an arrow flies from the dark?

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.440
We must still stay on guard.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.920
Hyah!

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.300
(Yuzhang)

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.000
His Majesty braved mortal danger

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.070
and came out of the city

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.750
to meet you before both armies
to talk alone,

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.500
only to put your worries to rest.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.360
You've seen it yourself.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.460
We only have three people on our side.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.760
But look how many stand behind you.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.050
Doesn't that give you confidence?

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:22.650
Mistress.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.200
They're all alone.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.340
Even if it's a trap,
we can still seize them

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:29.970
and negotiate with Liu Xun.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.350
You three, go with me.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.310
How dare you lie to me!

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.950
None of you will leave alive.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.230
Marquis.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:54.800
Wang told me to keep you safe.

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:56.140
You mustn't go anywhere.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:57.630
Do you want to go?

00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:59.370
Yes.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:00.580
Then do as I say.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:01.670
Sure.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:03.750
Call every brother to join us.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:04.590
Follow me.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:05.430
Yes.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:06.780
Go.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:43.970
Hyah!

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.390
Hyah!

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:49.960
Protect His Majesty!

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.110
Could it be the Marquis?

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:52.630
Hurry!

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:53.720
After them!

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.970
The Emperor is trying to flee!

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.280
Hyah!

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.240
Traitor!

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.360
You often see things blurry.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.550
You should massage this spot often.

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.760
This is the Yintang death acupoint.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.580
It houses the gate of qi and blood.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:41.270
If struck severely,

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:42.450
your energy will surge wildly,

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:43.770
and life will end instantly.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.790
But with proper nourishment,

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:47.530
it will shine like a lantern high above,

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:48.960
illuminating the mind and spirit

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.530
and making eyes clear and heart serene.

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:52.280
So, the Yintang acupoint

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:54.640
is the gate between life and death

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:56.590
and the window to enlightenment.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.080
When you are reading this book,

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:13.920
I fear I may have long departed
from you.

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:16.910
It has been over ten years
since you left.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.490
The Marquis took me to Haihun

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:21.630
and treated me kindly.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:25.290
Yet a woman from the Western Regions
forced me,

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.190
seeking the code of the Bronze Qilin.

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:31.040
Thinking of your safety,

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:32.810
I could only endure and comply.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.320
Thus, I devised a plot
against the Marquis.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.240
I had no choice.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.280
My heart is filled with guilt

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:40.610
towards the Marquis

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.040
and Lord Wang.

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:46.320
The Marquis treated us so kindly.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:48.720
If you can return one day,

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.840
serve the Marquis with all your heart.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.770
He is a kind and upright man.

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:53.920
He will never let you down.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.900
Remember to do good deeds.

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.440
The past friendship
between the Marquis and you

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.380
should also be kept close to your heart.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.860
Your father, Li Zhong.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.130
I've come to my senses.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.510
I am the Marquis's sworn brother.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:33.000
(Yuzhang)
Colonel.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:33.840
Lord Wang.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:36.630
I've brought every antidote
I could find.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.270
Leave this to me.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:42.870
Take care of it.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.480
Hyah!

00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:59.910
Scalp Wang!

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.040
Don't worry about me.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.090
I'll hold them off.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:02.950
Hyah!

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.100
Hyah!

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:07.960
Scalp Wang.

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:52.440
Scalp Wang!

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:53.490
Hyah!

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:55.750
Wang.

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:56.910
I'll hold them off for you.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.790
Hurry, the Marquis is in danger!

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:01.460
Hyah!

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:04.950
Whoa.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:05.830
Whoa.

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:06.850
Wang.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.760
Don't worry about me.

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:09.970
Go! Go now!

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:10.980
From this day on,

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.440
I'll be your personal VVIP.

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:16.290
- Then I'll be called Scalp Wang.
- What?

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.070
I grew up without a name.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:20.080
It's my greatest honor
to take your surname.

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:23.060
You'll always be my VVIP.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:47.860
Hyah!

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:52.390
Hold up here.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.040
Help me dismount.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.320
Come.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.700
I told you
I wouldn't let you risk yourself.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:02.840
Hyah!

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:04.760
Marquis!

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:34.870
Search every corner.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.990
Mistress, watch out.
There may be an ambush.

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:02.800
- Go.
- Go.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:04.610
Hurry!

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:14.470
Over there!

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:16.240
Chase!

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:17.580
Stop!

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:22.900
- Chase!
- Over there!

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.160
Chase!

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:34.670
Darn it.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.740

in circles.
