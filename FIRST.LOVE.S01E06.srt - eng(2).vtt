[Why our first love
always ends in heartbreak!]

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:10.051
Alright, listen up!

00:00:10.885 --> 00:00:12.929
Listen up, everyone. Look here!

00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:15.682
Okay, thank you.

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:19.853
So, a matchmaking company

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:22.313
ran a survey on single men and women
in their 20s and 30s

00:00:22.313 --> 00:00:24.649
and the results show

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:28.486
that two out of five said
their first love didn't work out.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.489
Well, so

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.491
he's kind of good-looking

00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:36.411
but not as good-looking as me.
Kim Se-joong.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.081
Why do you think
your first love didn't work out?

00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:42.751
Dude, why do you have to
bring up something so painful?

00:00:43.752 --> 00:00:44.961
Well...

00:00:46.087 --> 00:00:47.797
If I had to say

00:00:47.797 --> 00:00:50.133
I was afraid I'd get turned down.

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:52.469
Turned down?

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.721
Yeah, but the timing was off too.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.681
But on second thought

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.100
I don't think I had enough courage.

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.145
Alright, okay.

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:03.438
Hey!

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:07.358
The girl who falls
in and out of love easily, Kim Ina.

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:12.322
Why do you think
your first love didn't work out?

00:01:13.114 --> 00:01:14.324
Go away!

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:17.202
Man, why don't you just tell us, huh?

00:01:20.955 --> 00:01:23.124
What do you think the reason is?

00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:25.085
Well...

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:27.003
So, I...

00:01:28.713 --> 00:01:32.258
You're such a scaredy-cat that I bet
you haven't even had a first love yet.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:36.971
I mean, because you need courage
to like someone anyway.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:44.104
Get out of my way.

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:50.193
Yes, well...

00:01:52.153 --> 00:01:54.197
Turns out

00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:58.493
first loves don't work out
because people are scared and afraid.

00:01:58.493 --> 00:02:01.663
Alright, then. I'm signing off!
I aspire to be everyone's first love

00:02:03.915 --> 00:02:05.500
and I'm Park Jun-young.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.543
Thank you.

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:42.203
No, Park Jun-young.

00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:43.955
Wake up
you need to go to college, man.

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:56.885
Hey, Kim Ina.

00:02:58.261 --> 00:02:59.470
Can I have a sip?

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:01.806
Why should I say yes?

00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:04.434
Geez, just give me some.

00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:05.852
What do you think you're doing?

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:09.147
What? Is it too good to share with me?

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.815
Yeah! So what?

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.444
Hey, silence please.

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:17.155
Hey, silence please.

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:23.745
Of course, you're all talk and no action
so naturally, you don’t want to share.

00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:26.789
- You done talking?
- Yeah, I am! So what?

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:29.042
Park Jun-young, Kim Ina, keep it down.

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:34.172
Let go while I'm still asking.

00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:36.466
Yeah?

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.177
Okay, then...

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:45.934
Hey!

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:50.438
That was an accident...

00:03:51.522 --> 00:03:52.732
Sorry.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.427
Why do you think our school
keeps having power outages?

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:25.765
I heard it started when
the ghost grandma came out.

00:04:28.017 --> 00:04:30.353
What if the grandma ghost
flipped the fuse box?

00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:33.064
What are you talking about?

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:03.136
Guys.

00:05:05.054 --> 00:05:07.223
Want me to tell you an interesting story?

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.942
You're curious why
the power goes out, right?

00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:23.448
It's because the ghost grandma

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.286
appeared in the hallways
on the fourth floor!

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:34.792
- Hey!
- Are you crazy?

00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:37.920
If you wanna check, go see yourself.

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:40.423
But

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:45.011
get ready because you'll pass out.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.348
Come here.
Just get over here for a second.

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:49.974
Dude, he's out of his mind.

00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:01.986
- Get out of here.
- Get out.

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:09.327
Geez, this scaredy cat!

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:11.371
How will you be able to study?

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:16.709
There's no such thing as ghosts.

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:25.843
Guys.

00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:29.097
Did you know?

00:06:32.683 --> 00:06:34.394
The same thing happened

00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:38.314
a few days ago too.

00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:40.983
Seung-min was secretly smoking

00:06:41.275 --> 00:06:45.738
in the bathroom on the fourth floor

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:47.949
but suddenly

00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:49.867
he heard

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:52.495
creak

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:54.163
creak.

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:57.875
He heard someone
dragging something around.

00:06:59.168 --> 00:07:03.506
He came out to see what was going on

00:07:08.177 --> 00:07:10.388
but he couldn't hear the sound anymore.

00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:15.518
So he turned around
thinking he must've been hearing things

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:21.149
and right then, he made eye contact

00:07:23.734 --> 00:07:25.361
with the ghost grandma!

00:07:30.741 --> 00:07:33.619
But that ghost grandma...

00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:41.043
smiled creepily.

00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:47.550
Cut it out!

00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:57.894
You're bleeding.

00:07:59.353 --> 00:08:02.398
Why would you hit me?
I told you not to do that.

00:08:20.416 --> 00:08:21.709
No way...

00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:27.423
I think I left my phone in the classroom.

00:08:28.674 --> 00:08:29.926
Go with me!

00:08:30.801 --> 00:08:32.678
Man, I'm hungry all of a sudden.

00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:34.514
I'll be at the convenience store
having ramyeon.

00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:40.228
Me too. Se-joong!

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:46.984
Be careful of the ghost grandma.

00:08:48.152 --> 00:08:49.570
Wait for me!

00:08:53.115 --> 00:08:55.952
You think I'm a child?

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:58.162
You really think I'd fall for your lies?

00:08:58.162 --> 00:09:01.332
Fine, thanks guys. Thanks.

00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:16.138
A grandma ghost in a high school?
Makes no sense.

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:19.058
If you're gonna lie
at least make it believable.

00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:20.184
Kim Ina, that girl...

00:09:53.801 --> 00:09:55.761
Let's go, I've got it now.

00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:11.402
Nam Hyun-gyu, you jerk.

00:10:11.402 --> 00:10:13.613
You could've just come with me. Jerk.

00:10:21.203 --> 00:10:24.457
This is damn scary, seriously.

00:10:33.007 --> 00:10:34.383
I'm almost there.

00:10:34.925 --> 00:10:36.344
I'm almost there.

00:10:37.219 --> 00:10:39.096
I can do this.

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:42.475
Don't come!

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:44.143
Don't come.

00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:51.859
- But suddenly, he heard creak creak...
- You're almost there, Jun-young.

00:10:52.943 --> 00:10:55.571
He heard someone
dragging something around.

00:10:57.114 --> 00:10:58.574
What is that?

00:11:00.034 --> 00:11:01.410
What is it?

00:11:02.536 --> 00:11:04.830
But he couldn't hear the sound anymore.

00:11:06.582 --> 00:11:10.961
So he turned around
thinking he must've been hearing things...

00:12:32.126 --> 00:12:33.627
Park Jun-young.

00:12:34.128 --> 00:12:36.380
You're not just acting like
you passed out, are you?

00:12:48.934 --> 00:12:50.227
I'm leaving.

00:12:50.686 --> 00:12:52.605
I borrowed that cart, so bring it back.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:58.986
That was so embarrassing, seriously...

00:12:58.986 --> 00:13:00.696
Seriously, this is so embarrassing.

00:13:36.565 --> 00:13:38.818
What is this? Why didn't you leave?

00:13:39.276 --> 00:13:41.320
What? Are you embarrassed?

00:13:42.112 --> 00:13:43.405
Why would I be?

00:13:48.911 --> 00:13:51.121
Did you even take a look at yourself?

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:54.667
Hold on a second.

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:56.877
I'll show you right now.

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:01.590
Wow, you look amazing!

00:14:04.134 --> 00:14:05.427
Okay.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:18.107
Only I could stand here
and face you like this.

00:14:18.107 --> 00:14:20.860
Anyone else would've passed out by now.

00:14:22.486 --> 00:14:24.196
Is that why you passed out?

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:28.993
Me?

00:14:30.286 --> 00:14:31.495
When did I pass out?

00:14:31.745 --> 00:14:34.540
I don't remember passing out at all.

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:37.585
You're seeing things.

00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:39.169
You're definitely seeing things.

00:14:41.338 --> 00:14:44.967
See for yourself
how pathetic you look.

00:15:13.078 --> 00:15:14.121
Hey.

00:15:15.247 --> 00:15:17.666
I know I'm a joke to you
but this is too much.

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:20.169
How could you tell me
to look at how pathetic I am

00:15:20.419 --> 00:15:22.504
without even saying sorry?

00:15:23.297 --> 00:15:24.465
What about you?

00:15:24.465 --> 00:15:25.716
What did I do?

00:15:26.216 --> 00:15:28.552
Why'd you pretend like you were out
when you were awake?

00:15:31.096 --> 00:15:32.890
I was really worried!

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.518
Yeah, but

00:15:36.518 --> 00:15:39.647
who told you to scare me like that?

00:15:40.147 --> 00:15:42.024
You started it.

00:15:42.024 --> 00:15:44.568
You took my drink and made me spill it
and gave me a nosebleed!

00:15:46.195 --> 00:15:47.988
At least

00:15:47.988 --> 00:15:51.033
I don't trick people like you!
Okay?

00:15:54.411 --> 00:15:55.955
You're the same way.

00:15:57.706 --> 00:16:01.418
You think I'm a joke and a pushover!
That's why you walk all over me!

00:16:01.418 --> 00:16:03.629
When? When did I ever walk all over you?

00:16:13.347 --> 00:16:16.558
Don't look at me like that.

00:16:17.142 --> 00:16:18.811
Park Jun-young.

00:16:20.604 --> 00:16:22.147
You're the worst!

00:16:27.361 --> 00:16:28.862
What? Why?

00:16:28.862 --> 00:16:30.489
What did I do?

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.370
Hey.

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.497
Seriously! Geez!

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:45.546
Dude, I can understand why he passed out.

00:16:55.305 --> 00:16:56.598
Why're you here?

00:16:56.598 --> 00:16:58.142
You left me earlier.

00:16:58.517 --> 00:17:00.936
Ina called us crying
because you passed out.

00:17:01.562 --> 00:17:03.897
But did you guys get in a fight again?

00:17:05.941 --> 00:17:07.192
Whatever.

00:17:42.269 --> 00:17:43.479
Jun-young.

00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:45.230
Jun-young, are you okay?

00:17:49.276 --> 00:17:53.655
What do I do?
He needs to go to the hospital. 911.

00:18:08.504 --> 00:18:10.297
Why would she
mess around if she's gonna cry?

00:18:11.256 --> 00:18:13.133
And how does she expect me
to open my eyes in that situation?

00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:15.928
Man, that's embarrassing.

00:18:17.721 --> 00:18:19.556
Jerk.

00:18:20.682 --> 00:18:23.560
He's the one who tricked me.

00:18:25.979 --> 00:18:28.524
You promised pizza
if you snacked during your diet!

00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:31.068
Don't run away like a coward!

00:18:31.068 --> 00:18:35.906
All talk and no action! Stop right there!

00:18:36.406 --> 00:18:38.283
It was my first time

00:18:39.743 --> 00:18:43.372
getting butterflies
while running hand in hand with a guy.

00:18:51.338 --> 00:18:52.548
Not here.

00:19:08.188 --> 00:19:09.606
Hey...

00:19:13.861 --> 00:19:16.780
We still need to get rid of the evidence.

00:19:20.784 --> 00:19:22.035
Wipe it up.

00:19:22.077 --> 00:19:25.414
The first time someone
wiped cream off my face.

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:43.307
The first time I listened to music
with a guy on a bus.

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:45.851
Kim Ina.

00:19:55.611 --> 00:19:58.655
It was the first time

00:19:58.989 --> 00:20:01.408
someone got me treats every day.

00:20:33.148 --> 00:20:36.151
You made me get so many butterflies.

00:20:37.194 --> 00:20:39.196
You made me like you

00:20:39.738 --> 00:20:43.992
and acted like you'd ask me out, but...

00:20:55.003 --> 00:20:57.172
Try being on time for once, huh?

00:20:59.675 --> 00:21:00.676
Here.

00:21:04.179 --> 00:21:05.973
This isn't

00:21:06.723 --> 00:21:09.726
a love letter or anything, right?

00:21:11.895 --> 00:21:13.021
Huh?

00:21:15.232 --> 00:21:16.900
What's with you?

00:21:17.276 --> 00:21:20.529
Let's just be friends.

00:21:20.946 --> 00:21:23.282
If we break up, it'll be awkward...

00:21:23.824 --> 00:21:25.742
We see each other every day...

00:21:26.702 --> 00:21:28.453
I don't want it to get awkward.

00:21:29.538 --> 00:21:30.706
Take it back.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.894
We're gonna be late.
Let's go.

00:21:57.941 --> 00:21:59.109
Aren't you coming?

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:03.947
Why would you trample all over

00:22:04.364 --> 00:22:08.118
the things I felt for the first time?

00:22:19.212 --> 00:22:20.797
[Jun-young]

00:22:20.797 --> 00:22:23.216
You didn't go around telling people
what happened, right?

00:22:23.216 --> 00:22:24.343
Are you asleep?

00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:26.636
Do the right thing
and delete the video and picture.

00:22:28.138 --> 00:22:29.765
Why aren't you replying?

00:22:31.558 --> 00:22:33.310
I'll apologize
for giving you a nosebleed too.

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:35.270
So you keep this a secret too!

00:22:40.567 --> 00:22:42.361
You jerk.

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:54.164
Why won't she reply?

00:22:57.209 --> 00:22:58.502
Kim Ina, seriously.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.388
[Passed out because
he's afraid of ghosts!]

00:23:09.388 --> 00:23:10.597
What is that?

00:23:13.266 --> 00:23:14.851
Man, seriously...

00:23:15.602 --> 00:23:18.563
Kim Ina, you wanna fight, huh?

00:23:20.232 --> 00:23:22.442
You're dead.

00:23:28.698 --> 00:23:31.785
[If you tell the other kids
I'm sending this to everyone at school]

00:23:41.336 --> 00:23:43.755
I thought you were on a diet.

00:23:46.091 --> 00:23:48.677
Hey, Ji-yoon.
You still believe that?

00:23:48.677 --> 00:23:50.053
What's Ina's nickname?

00:23:50.303 --> 00:23:52.806
All talk and no action.

00:23:54.391 --> 00:23:56.810
- Correct!
- Give it back.

00:23:57.644 --> 00:23:59.646
People keep asking me

00:23:59.646 --> 00:24:01.606
why you're going on a diet
when you're already skinny.

00:24:04.192 --> 00:24:06.069
It's because of my cheeks.

00:24:06.486 --> 00:24:09.322
But no matter how hard I try
it won't go away. So annoying.

00:24:09.322 --> 00:24:10.657
They're cute...

00:24:12.033 --> 00:24:15.162
By the way, where's Jun-young?

00:24:17.038 --> 00:24:18.748
He's probably
too embarrassed to show his face.

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:30.719
[Park Jun-young]

00:24:38.935 --> 00:24:42.522
Didn't you know? Ina dressed up
like a ghost and made Jun-young pass out.

00:24:42.522 --> 00:24:44.608
Huh? So that's what you did?

00:24:45.108 --> 00:24:46.485
You should've held back.

00:24:46.485 --> 00:24:48.445
You know Jun-young's a scaredy cat.

00:24:48.904 --> 00:24:50.322
Why?

00:24:50.322 --> 00:24:52.991
It's nothing compared to
what Park Jun-young did to me.

00:24:52.991 --> 00:24:54.826
They say people who fight
end up catching feelings.

00:24:54.826 --> 00:24:56.286
You two might end up dating.

00:24:57.412 --> 00:24:59.623
Don't go running your mouth
because it's not your business.

00:25:00.582 --> 00:25:02.542
That's what I'm saying!

00:25:03.084 --> 00:25:05.212
Yeah, yeah.

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:08.882
Yeah, eat up.

00:25:09.466 --> 00:25:10.592
Eat.

00:25:19.267 --> 00:25:20.393
Hey.

00:25:20.894 --> 00:25:22.604
Why won't you pick up my calls?

00:25:23.271 --> 00:25:25.065
Stop getting on my nerves
and get away from me.

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.573
You didn't tell anyone, did you?

00:25:34.324 --> 00:25:36.952
If they find out, I'll be so embarrassed
I won't be able to come to school.

00:25:36.952 --> 00:25:38.411
Yeah, well who told you
to embarrass yourself?

00:25:38.411 --> 00:25:40.664
It's all your fault!
If only you didn't mess with me!

00:25:41.831 --> 00:25:43.875
Yeah, it's all my fault, isn't it?

00:25:43.875 --> 00:25:46.002
It's my fault you passed out
when you saw me, and pretended...

00:25:48.547 --> 00:25:49.714
Hey, Kim Ina.

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:53.134
The owner at the store
said he needs his cart back.

00:25:55.136 --> 00:25:56.763
Oh...

00:25:57.055 --> 00:25:58.807
The cart.

00:25:59.474 --> 00:26:00.892
Of course.

00:26:00.892 --> 00:26:04.187
Let me go return the cart.

00:26:17.993 --> 00:26:19.578
Hey, wait!

00:26:32.591 --> 00:26:35.969
Ina, you didn't hear the creaking sound
that Jun-young was talking about?

00:26:37.637 --> 00:26:39.848
Hey, take a second to think about it.

00:26:40.557 --> 00:26:42.517
Creak, creak.

00:26:43.018 --> 00:26:44.894
Creak, creak?

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:48.690
Creak, creak.

00:26:50.609 --> 00:26:52.110
What is that?

00:27:01.411 --> 00:27:04.122
I'm not sure.
I'll let you know after I think about it.

00:27:04.497 --> 00:27:06.082
Scaredy cat.

00:27:08.585 --> 00:27:09.836
Oh!

00:27:10.378 --> 00:27:13.256
- Jun-young, you should be careful.
- What?

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:17.010
Everyone who's seen the ghost grandma
ended up at the hospital.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:22.307
Watch out for the stairs and the windows.

00:27:24.267 --> 00:27:25.518
Windows?

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.385
Hey, Park Jun-young. What's wrong?

00:28:02.931 --> 00:28:04.307
What do I do?

00:28:06.559 --> 00:28:08.353
I think I saw the ghost grandma.

00:28:17.737 --> 00:28:19.531
Reports of ghost grandma sightings

00:28:20.031 --> 00:28:22.659
have been flooding in at Soorim High.

00:28:24.452 --> 00:28:25.829
Right here

00:28:26.371 --> 00:28:29.416
they actually caught what looks like
the ghost grandma on camera

00:28:29.749 --> 00:28:32.210
adding more weight
to the recent sightings.

00:28:38.425 --> 00:28:39.801
You heard that, right?

00:28:41.594 --> 00:28:44.514
They say you can hear this sound
every time the ghost grandma appears.

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.601
What could this sound
be trying to tell us?

00:28:52.272 --> 00:28:54.482
What if there really is a grandma ghost?

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:01.614
Aw, is the little baby scared?

00:29:03.283 --> 00:29:04.409
No.

00:29:04.659 --> 00:29:07.579
Didn't you know?
I'm a capital T.

00:29:08.121 --> 00:29:10.373
Who would believe something like that?

00:29:19.466 --> 00:29:21.968
My stomach hurts.
Let's go to the bathroom.

00:29:22.218 --> 00:29:25.305
- Go by yourself.
- You jerk, seriously...

00:29:32.103 --> 00:29:33.521
Want me to go with you?

00:29:34.814 --> 00:29:36.065
It's fine.

00:29:36.065 --> 00:29:39.652
Well, you are a guy
so you must have an ego.

00:29:40.987 --> 00:29:44.908
Oh, but maybe being a scaredy cat
has nothing to do with being a man.

00:29:45.658 --> 00:29:46.951
You better cut that out.

00:29:47.202 --> 00:29:49.162
Why? Did I scratch your ego?

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:21.110
Well, you are a guy
so you must have an ego.

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:24.072
Park Jun-young.
What's wrong with you?

00:30:24.781 --> 00:30:26.950
This is why she says that kind of stuff!

00:30:42.048 --> 00:30:44.008
Oh, my stomach hurts...

00:30:49.556 --> 00:30:53.977
But suddenly, he heard creak creak...

00:30:55.311 --> 00:30:57.939
He heard someone
dragging something around.

00:30:59.732 --> 00:31:03.778
Oh, but maybe being a scaredy cat
has nothing to do with being a man.

00:31:07.073 --> 00:31:08.366
Park Jun-young.

00:31:08.825 --> 00:31:12.036
Show her you're a man, dude.
You're a man!

00:31:13.037 --> 00:31:14.414
You can do it.

00:31:43.818 --> 00:31:45.153
Hey, it's fine.

00:31:45.612 --> 00:31:47.280
It's nothing, nothing at all.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.698
You're fine, man.

00:32:57.308 --> 00:32:58.726
Are you going to the bathroom?

00:32:58.726 --> 00:33:00.061
I'll go with you.

00:33:00.061 --> 00:33:03.064
No, I'm just gonna get some fresh air
because I'm sleepy.

00:33:15.827 --> 00:33:17.078
The grandma...

00:33:17.537 --> 00:33:18.955
Grandma...

00:33:37.515 --> 00:33:38.766
Jun-young!

00:33:46.733 --> 00:33:48.109
Ina was worried sick about you.

00:33:48.109 --> 00:33:50.028
- She cried the whole way here.
- Yeah!

00:33:50.611 --> 00:33:53.406
Whatever, I'm gonna get some rest.

00:33:56.409 --> 00:33:58.161
Okay, we'll go.

00:33:58.161 --> 00:34:00.038
Get some rest
and see you tomorrow.

00:34:04.167 --> 00:34:06.335
Why'd I have to
pass out in front of Ina again?

00:34:07.879 --> 00:34:09.881
I’m so embarrassed I could die!

00:34:14.177 --> 00:34:16.971
What's wrong with me?
You guys are fine

00:34:16.971 --> 00:34:19.682
but why does this keep happening to me?

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:23.311
Every time Ina looks at me
like I'm pathetic

00:34:24.437 --> 00:34:26.314
I wanna die of embarrassment!

00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:30.985
I've been meaning to ask you this

00:34:31.778 --> 00:34:34.363
but why'd you turn her down
when you like her?

00:34:43.956 --> 00:34:46.459
Are you gonna go out with Jun-young?

00:34:49.712 --> 00:34:51.005
Maybe?

00:34:52.048 --> 00:34:53.674
Aren't you worried?

00:34:53.674 --> 00:34:55.468
What if you guys break up?

00:34:55.635 --> 00:34:59.514
We haven't even started dating yet
so why worry about it already?

00:35:00.431 --> 00:35:04.936
Bong-hee, what would you say
if your friend asks you out?

00:35:06.187 --> 00:35:08.231
I'd want to stay friends.

00:35:08.731 --> 00:35:11.192
Even if someone
you really like asked you out?

00:35:11.776 --> 00:35:12.944
Yeah.

00:35:12.944 --> 00:35:16.155
Because if we break up
we might not even be able to stay friends.

00:35:17.406 --> 00:35:19.951
I guess, that makes sense.

00:35:19.951 --> 00:35:21.953
It'd be uncomfortable and awkward.

00:35:22.328 --> 00:35:25.498
Yeah, so isn't it better
to just stay friends?

00:35:27.166 --> 00:35:28.459
Maybe?

00:35:30.586 --> 00:35:32.797
That really scared me.

00:35:34.298 --> 00:35:36.634
If we break up, we're strangers.

00:35:38.636 --> 00:35:42.265
But if we stay friends
we can still be in each other's lives.

00:35:43.808 --> 00:35:45.393
I want her in my life.

00:35:46.144 --> 00:35:48.229
Whoa, you're such a scaredy cat.

00:35:49.397 --> 00:35:51.149
By the way, why'd you go back
for your phone that day?

00:35:51.149 --> 00:35:53.484
Knowing you, I didn't think you'd go.

00:35:54.026 --> 00:35:55.194
Yeah.

00:35:55.319 --> 00:35:57.238
What kind of secrets do you have on there?

00:36:10.168 --> 00:36:11.836
Isn't she so cute?

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:14.630
Look at her chubby cheeks.

00:36:17.425 --> 00:36:19.010
This is too cringey.

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:21.345
Stop it, seriously.
Put it down, turn it off.

00:36:24.974 --> 00:36:26.767
She's totally my type.

00:36:31.105 --> 00:36:32.356
You dummy.

00:36:32.356 --> 00:36:35.735
Just be a man and tell her

00:36:35.735 --> 00:36:38.863
that you were just afraid you'd break up.

00:36:38.863 --> 00:36:40.907
That you're sorry, and you like her.

00:36:43.576 --> 00:36:46.621
I've already embarrassed myself.
How could I go tell her?

00:36:47.163 --> 00:36:48.539
I'm a man too, you know?

00:36:50.291 --> 00:36:51.500
Well.

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:53.753
I get what you mean
the timing's not right.

00:36:55.421 --> 00:36:58.382
Yeah, now's not the right time.

00:37:08.851 --> 00:37:11.020
What about Jun-young? Is he okay?

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:12.939
Yeah, he's fine.

00:37:13.189 --> 00:37:14.523
Don't worry too much.

00:37:15.274 --> 00:37:16.442
Really?

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:18.819
That's a relief.

00:37:20.488 --> 00:37:23.824
Jun-young's mom told us

00:37:25.034 --> 00:37:28.537
that he's been having nightmares
and he hasn't been able to sleep or eat.

00:37:28.996 --> 00:37:32.833
So, she said she thought he was
getting beat or bullied at school...

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:35.753
It's all my fault.

00:37:36.337 --> 00:37:38.339
If only I hadn't messed with him...

00:37:39.298 --> 00:37:41.008
Ina, Jun-young...

00:37:44.345 --> 00:37:45.763
What about Jun-young?

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:50.351
No, it's just
Jun-young's fine

00:37:51.102 --> 00:37:52.728
so don't beat yourself up too much.

00:37:56.649 --> 00:37:57.817
See you.

00:38:08.619 --> 00:38:11.872
Jun-young, hold on just a bit longer.

00:38:13.124 --> 00:38:15.209
I'll figure out

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.878
who the ghost grandma is

00:38:18.462 --> 00:38:19.630
for sure.

00:38:38.482 --> 00:38:40.568
Do you feel any better?

00:38:43.029 --> 00:38:45.573
You're not at school

00:38:45.573 --> 00:38:47.533
and I'm worried.

00:38:48.951 --> 00:38:50.328
Hi.

00:38:54.665 --> 00:38:56.083
Alright, listen up.

00:38:56.125 --> 00:38:59.670
Jun-young can't come today
because he doesn't feel good

00:39:00.421 --> 00:39:02.590
and I'm saying this out of concern...

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:06.010
Don't get caught up in the ghost grandma
rumors and focus on your studies.

00:39:07.261 --> 00:39:08.846
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:39:08.846 --> 00:39:11.182
Those who score lower than the midterm

00:39:11.682 --> 00:39:14.852
will experience a terror far worse
than the grandma ghost.

00:39:14.852 --> 00:39:16.145
Okay?

00:39:16.145 --> 00:39:17.813
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:39:30.701 --> 00:39:32.953
Ina, are you okay?

00:39:35.456 --> 00:39:36.749
No.

00:39:37.333 --> 00:39:40.836
What if Jun-young
never wants to see me again?

00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:48.094
He's so annoying and I can't stand him

00:39:50.721 --> 00:39:53.516
but I feel sad
when he doesn't come talk to me.

00:39:55.142 --> 00:39:59.688
I hated myself for feeling that way
and my pride got hurt, so I was mean

00:40:03.317 --> 00:40:09.323
but I heard he hasn't been able to
eat or sleep because he has nightmares.

00:40:10.616 --> 00:40:13.285
I didn't know it'd be so serious.

00:40:14.787 --> 00:40:18.207
Don't worry, he'll get better soon.

00:40:20.334 --> 00:40:25.214
If I apologize sincerely
do you think he'll accept it?

00:40:25.673 --> 00:40:27.550
Of course.

00:40:27.758 --> 00:40:29.427
Of course he will.

[Night study hall]

00:40:43.816 --> 00:40:45.234
Do you want me to go with you?

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:48.946
No.

00:40:49.447 --> 00:40:51.365
I have to figure this out.

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:54.577
I'll just come back
if I can't handle it.

00:41:10.926 --> 00:41:12.511
Will she be okay?

00:41:13.471 --> 00:41:16.515
I heard the fourth floor
still doesn't have power.

00:41:17.266 --> 00:41:19.852
There must really be a ghost.

Whoa! Why's she calling?

00:43:01.161 --> 00:43:02.621

- Hey, Kim Ina!

00:43:06.959 --> 00:43:08.252
Geez, seriously!

00:43:16.719 --> 00:43:17.928
Hey.

Did Ina really disappear?

We're going to go look for her.

00:43:38.115 --> 00:43:40.159
What are you guys doing? Go home!

00:43:42.036 --> 00:43:43.370
That really hurts, sir.
It really hurts.

Heo Tae-woong.

00:43:53.088 --> 00:43:55.633
Why do you look like that?

00:43:55.633 --> 00:43:57.885
- What about Ina?
- Huh?

00:44:00.512 --> 00:44:01.597
What about Ina?

00:44:02.097 --> 00:44:03.390
- She's not back yet.

Hey, Kim Ina!

She's my mother.

00:46:21.487 --> 00:46:22.946
You were scared, weren't you?

00:46:25.949 --> 00:46:27.826
I feel terrible.

00:46:28.619 --> 00:46:31.288
I was getting ready to
move her into a nursing home

00:46:32.122 --> 00:46:34.666
but I had no idea
things would blow up like this.

00:46:36.668 --> 00:46:39.713
Mom, that's not Dong-su.

00:46:40.047 --> 00:46:42.466
Let's go home, okay?

00:46:42.841 --> 00:46:45.803
Dong-su, I'm sorry.

00:46:46.011 --> 00:46:47.888
I'm sorry, Dong-su.

00:46:57.648 --> 00:46:59.900
As soon as I looked into
the grandma's eyes

00:47:00.275 --> 00:47:02.152
I wasn't scared or terrified.

00:47:02.152 --> 00:47:04.905
I felt a sadness I couldn’t
even begin to explain.

00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:15.916
Our school used to be

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:19.795
the site of the night school
where my mom studied back in the day.

00:47:20.379 --> 00:47:22.381
She said she met her first love here.

Play it for me when you're ready.
That's all I need.

They fell in love and got engaged

00:48:08.468 --> 00:48:12.931
but her stepmother forced her
to marry a wealthy divorcé instead.

00:48:12.931 --> 00:48:15.225
So, they were going to run away together

00:48:20.939 --> 00:48:24.318

to leave her younger siblings behind.

Choi Hyun-soo.

00:49:03.106 --> 00:49:08.487
I think she spent her whole life believing
that what happened to him was her fault.

00:49:11.323 --> 00:49:16.954
She spent 46 years living with
guilt and longing for him.

00:49:18.789 --> 00:49:21.875
After the dementia set in
I guess she thinks of him even more.

00:49:21.875 --> 00:49:23.585
That's why she came to the school

00:49:25.837 --> 00:49:28.799
and she must've come more often
because she saw you, who look like him.

She's been

that I take you for a joke
and look down on you.

It's obvious we'll break up later.

It's better not to start at all

than to waste time and emotions.

Okay, fine, I’ll give you that.

00:52:45.579 --> 00:52:47.664
But if you wanted to end it
why not just end it?

00:52:47.664 --> 00:52:50.584
Why do you keep messing with me
and making things harder?

00:52:51.543 --> 00:52:53.420
If I don't do that

00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:56.506

You always ignore me

and never come talk to me.

00:53:08.768 --> 00:53:10.687
That's really unfair.

00:53:11.104 --> 00:53:13.148
Do you not care about how others feel?

What about me?
Don't you consider how I feel?

00:53:17.736 --> 00:53:21.781
When you treat me like nothing happened
and just joke around...

00:53:25.869 --> 00:53:28.663
That's taking me for a joke
and a pushover.

00:53:31.958 --> 00:53:34.461

That's why I took your hand
and ran without even thinking.

behind the auditorium doors

00:55:01.589 --> 00:55:03.508
I thought my heart was gonna explode.

00:55:06.136 --> 00:55:08.763
And when the guy
on the skateboard came flying at us

00:55:08.763 --> 00:55:11.016
I was so scared you'd get hurt.

00:55:17.647 --> 00:55:19.024
Eat up.

00:55:19.024 --> 00:55:20.191
Are you happy?

00:55:20.608 --> 00:55:22.819
The way you eat was so cute

00:55:23.403 --> 00:55:25.363
that I kept wanting to give you stuff.

00:55:27.282 --> 00:55:28.783
Actually

00:55:29.743 --> 00:55:33.955
I only said all those things
because I was afraid we'd break up.

00:55:50.263 --> 00:55:52.098
I still like you.

00:55:53.224 --> 00:55:56.019
No, I never stopped liking you.

00:56:03.902 --> 00:56:05.737
[Passed out because
he's afraid of ghosts!]

00:56:13.661 --> 00:56:15.538
If you'll have me

00:56:17.874 --> 00:56:19.459
do you want to go out with me?

00:56:22.545 --> 00:56:23.630
Yeah.

00:56:25.256 --> 00:56:26.424
Really?

00:56:26.841 --> 00:56:29.427
You can't change your mind. Okay?

00:56:30.095 --> 00:56:31.429
Kim Ina is mine!

00:56:31.429 --> 00:56:32.722
Kim Ina is mine!

00:56:39.062 --> 00:56:43.650
The summer we were 18
our first love began.

00:56:44.109 --> 00:56:47.404
We were too awkward and scared
to tell each other how we felt

00:56:47.404 --> 00:56:51.408
but I realized something when I saw
the grandma who let her love slip away.

00:56:52.283 --> 00:56:55.286
First love takes courage.

00:57:20.854 --> 00:57:24.065
[First Love]
