A story about first love
that all Koreans love.

00:00:21.356 --> 00:00:25.055
This summer, a love like watercolors
that will touch the hearts

00:00:25.577 --> 00:00:27.986
of the students at Soorim High will come.

Here, a present for you.

00:00:46.934 --> 00:00:48.170
Thanks.

00:00:48.353 --> 00:00:49.735
It suits you.

00:00:54.811 --> 00:00:55.990
Are you okay?

00:01:16.694 --> 00:01:22.020
We realized something while reading
and acting out the novel "Rain Shower."

00:01:33.634 --> 00:01:36.777
No matter how short

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:39.829
your first love leaves
an imprint on your heart.

Lord

00:05:07.297 --> 00:05:10.481
this morning, Philip became a man.

00:05:10.482 --> 00:05:12.360
I thought he was still a little kid

00:05:12.361 --> 00:05:15.886
but before I knew it, he's all grown up
and having wet dreams.

00:05:15.887 --> 00:05:17.078
Mom!

00:05:17.079 --> 00:05:21.089
He's at the age where his hormones are
running wild, so he needs to be careful.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.696
So, Lord

00:05:22.987 --> 00:05:26.462
if Philip gets all worked up in public

00:05:26.463 --> 00:05:28.249
let him hold on to his manhood

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.307
and help him so he can rely on you.

00:05:31.308 --> 00:05:33.328
In the name of Jesus Christ.

00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:36.024
- Amen.
- Mom!

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.385
Here, eat this. Have some peppers.

00:05:40.386 --> 00:05:41.578

00:05:51.424 --> 00:05:54.294
happy wet dream to you.

00:05:54.295 --> 00:05:57.251
Alright.
Now blow, Philip.

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.727
Fine, at least you guys are enjoying this.

00:06:02.094 --> 00:06:03.627
- Ouch, that's hot.
- Let's go.

00:06:05.844 --> 00:06:08.738
Where are you going?
You have to eat your wet dream treat.

00:06:08.739 --> 00:06:10.785
Geez, I shouldn't have told you guys.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.130
Happy wet dream to you.

00:06:13.131 --> 00:06:15.909
Knock it off, seriously.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.554
Okay, dude. Fine.

00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:21.316
How did it feel
to have a wet dream, though?

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.686
Is it weird?
Or did you feel uncomfortable?

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.991
What? You haven't had one?

00:06:26.992 --> 00:06:29.671
No, not all men have them.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.115
You fell asleep during sex ed, didn't you?

00:06:32.395 --> 00:06:35.060
People who make themselves
feel good like Woong

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:37.088
don't even have any sperm left.

00:06:37.723 --> 00:06:41.501
Then how about no jerking off
starting today so we can have wet dreams?

I'm starting my student teaching today!

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:37.738
That's why I tried to dress
as plain and neat as possible.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.084
How do I look?

00:07:41.731 --> 00:07:43.597
Do I not look like myself?

00:07:45.314 --> 00:07:47.526
For the next month

00:07:47.527 --> 00:07:51.384
I'll be going for
more subtle and plain looks.

00:07:51.789 --> 00:07:54.917
Even if it feels a bit strange

00:07:55.315 --> 00:07:58.242
I hope stay tuned to see my new looks!

Hey, what are you doing
so early in the morning?

00:08:05.245 --> 00:08:07.018
Oh, you scared me.

You should've told me you were here!

00:08:08.689 --> 00:08:10.804
Wow, you're amazing.

00:08:10.805 --> 00:08:12.072
I mean, aren't you nervous?

00:08:12.383 --> 00:08:14.514
How can you film a vlog in here?

00:08:14.515 --> 00:08:16.298

I had to take something to calm down!

00:08:18.432 --> 00:08:21.103

- I guess.

Right.

00:08:22.632 --> 00:08:24.772
After my dad found out
you were a TA for a star instructor

00:08:24.773 --> 00:08:26.567
he said he'll set up
a special class for you if you do well.

00:08:26.866 --> 00:08:28.603
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.181
But he said he wants
a video of you teaching first.

00:08:31.182 --> 00:08:32.460
He said he'll decide
after watching that.

00:08:32.764 --> 00:08:35.041
Wow, Soo-young!

00:08:35.268 --> 00:08:37.405

00:08:37.406 --> 00:08:40.892
and impress your father

00:08:41.261 --> 00:08:42.552
Okay.

00:08:42.553 --> 00:08:45.141
But why do you want to
become a star instructor anyway?

in luxury clothes from head to toe

00:08:55.435 --> 00:08:57.654

with a view of the Han River

00:09:11.542 --> 00:09:13.544

00:10:01.411 --> 00:10:03.284

This is strange.

00:10:20.703 --> 00:10:22.220

No, it's nothing like that.

I'm just not sure what I want to do.

No, I absolutely love spicy food.

He's thinking about you again...

00:23:25.325 --> 00:23:27.671
Philip has been very worried
about his future lately

00:23:27.672 --> 00:23:29.658
so he keeps leaving while eating

00:23:29.659 --> 00:23:31.119
and getting indigestion and stuff...

00:23:32.477 --> 00:23:33.617
That's right!

00:23:33.618 --> 00:23:35.756
He's been very strange lately.

00:23:36.575 --> 00:23:39.324
I think it'd be nice
if you could go comfort him.

00:23:39.782 --> 00:23:40.894

Can we talk?

00:24:18.277 --> 00:24:21.916
It's normal for you to not be sure
of your future at your age.

00:24:22.808 --> 00:24:24.742
There's still so much
you haven't done yet.

00:24:25.108 --> 00:24:26.964
You'll find something

00:24:27.758 --> 00:24:29.632
once you start doing things.

00:24:31.232 --> 00:24:34.351
But my mom's very worried.

00:24:35.081 --> 00:24:38.149
That's why I've taken
aptitude tests and everything

00:24:39.093 --> 00:24:40.607
but I'm still not sure.

00:24:41.489 --> 00:24:43.908
So I'm just going to choose a major

00:24:52.017 --> 00:24:53.804
not your head.

00:24:54.567 --> 00:24:56.113
In your heart?

00:24:56.114 --> 00:24:57.936
Yeah, your heart.

If you find joy and happiness in something

00:25:02.961 --> 00:25:05.560
it's worth giving it a try.

00:25:06.627 --> 00:25:10.217
Ultimately, that'll become a stepping stone
to finding your dreams.

00:25:12.939 --> 00:25:15.791
My dream was to become an idol.

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:20.851
Though my dream
of becoming an idol was crushed

00:25:21.891 --> 00:25:24.803
I gave it my best shot
and because of that

00:25:25.062 --> 00:25:28.041
I found the courage to pursue
my new dream of becoming a teacher.

00:25:30.049 --> 00:25:31.743

If that's too hard

00:25:37.597 --> 00:25:39.929
doing your best in the present
is also a good option.

00:25:41.036 --> 00:25:43.646
If you keep trying your best

00:25:44.283 --> 00:25:47.772

00:25:49.131 --> 00:25:50.600

Wouldn't it be better
to come up with something new

00:26:53.679 --> 00:26:55.185
for the festival instead of doing a cover?

00:26:55.933 --> 00:26:58.305

anything other than covers.

Believe it or not

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:07.165
I was an idol trainee.

00:27:07.678 --> 00:27:09.752
I'm the one who made this dance group.

But I'm not really a fan of overusing
creativity in situations like this.

00:29:44.638 --> 00:29:45.868
Yeah, well...

00:29:45.869 --> 00:29:47.418
Just give me your number.

00:29:47.722 --> 00:29:49.882
I'm not gonna call you anyway.
It's for a bet.

00:29:51.177 --> 00:29:53.268
More the reason
I shouldn't give it to you.

00:29:57.363 --> 00:29:58.616
Then...

00:30:00.306 --> 00:30:01.582
What about this?

00:30:07.888 --> 00:30:09.985
- Did you take this?
- Yeah.

00:30:10.458 --> 00:30:12.489
I filmed it with my own hands.

00:30:15.614 --> 00:30:18.254
- So what?
- Huh?

00:30:18.255 --> 00:30:19.907
Who do you think is in the wrong?

00:30:19.908 --> 00:30:21.885
The adult who went to the club?
Or the minor?

00:30:22.924 --> 00:30:24.785
Threaten me one more time

00:30:24.947 --> 00:30:26.909
and I'll tell your parents right away.

00:30:27.203 --> 00:30:28.379
Got it?

00:30:28.755 --> 00:30:30.949
Jesus Christ.

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:32.440
Jesus Christ?

00:30:34.651 --> 00:30:36.139
You...

00:30:39.018 --> 00:30:40.691
Saved by the bell, huh?

00:30:55.005 --> 00:30:56.921
Wow, Oh Lola.

00:30:57.736 --> 00:30:59.874
You're a saint.

00:31:01.367 --> 00:31:03.411
Seriously...

00:31:03.896 --> 00:31:05.211
What happened?

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:07.126
I mean...

00:31:09.817 --> 00:31:10.934
Never mind.

00:31:13.988 --> 00:31:16.292
Teaching really isn't for anyone.

00:31:17.325 --> 00:31:19.017
Right...

00:31:23.486 --> 00:31:25.414
[You can do it, Lola]

00:31:44.157 --> 00:31:47.421
[Lee Jinho]
Don't accept him, he's a high schooler.

00:31:47.422 --> 00:31:49.075
He's a student of mine.

00:31:54.555 --> 00:31:56.747
Should I teach class with this on?

00:31:56.903 --> 00:31:58.142
Nope.

00:31:58.143 --> 00:31:59.935
I think the kids will like it.

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:02.526
You really don't like it?

00:32:02.663 --> 00:32:04.070
Not at all.

00:32:08.397 --> 00:32:09.697
Oh, I'm getting a call.

00:32:12.686 --> 00:32:13.956
Hello?

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.092
- This is LUX.
- Huh?

00:32:16.108 --> 00:32:18.680
- Lee Jinho is here.
- Oh...

00:32:19.557 --> 00:32:21.053
I'll be right there.

00:32:37.324 --> 00:32:39.538
Hey, is it just you two?

00:32:39.539 --> 00:32:40.570
What?

00:32:40.571 --> 00:32:42.179
Is it just you two?

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:43.243
Yeah.

00:32:43.473 --> 00:32:45.837
I've had my eyes on you

00:32:45.838 --> 00:32:48.186
and we have some drinks left at our table.

00:32:48.187 --> 00:32:50.184
Do you want to join us?

00:32:50.185 --> 00:32:51.591
Okay, sure.

00:32:54.624 --> 00:32:55.950
You come with me.

00:32:55.951 --> 00:32:58.775
- Why now...
- This guy, seriously!

00:32:59.412 --> 00:33:00.979
Let go of me.

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:03.416
You'll run away if I do.

00:33:04.358 --> 00:33:05.551
See you later.

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:09.152
You're a student, you shouldn't be here!

00:33:10.361 --> 00:33:12.244
How'd you get through security?

00:33:14.439 --> 00:33:15.915
Do you know someone here?

00:33:16.815 --> 00:33:18.726
What? He was a high schooler?

00:33:19.902 --> 00:33:21.835
Damn, this is really annoying.

00:33:22.347 --> 00:33:23.450
Let's go.

00:33:24.228 --> 00:33:27.163
Fuck, this is seriously so annoying.

00:33:27.164 --> 00:33:28.751
What? Fuck?

00:33:31.409 --> 00:33:33.837
Hey Jinho, cut it out.

00:33:41.802 --> 00:33:42.978
- Yeah, dude.
- Yeah, dude.

00:33:42.979 --> 00:33:44.663
- Be respectful to your teacher.
- Be respectful to your teacher.

00:33:44.664 --> 00:33:46.145
What are you guys doing here?

00:33:46.553 --> 00:33:47.919
Are you her little minions?

00:33:48.897 --> 00:33:50.029
Lee Jinho!

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:51.253
What?

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:56.493
Why are you acting like a teacher
when you're nothing but a student teacher?

00:33:58.976 --> 00:34:00.177
Ms. Oh.

00:34:00.462 --> 00:34:02.884
Just leave.
I don't think you should be here.

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:07.003
Wow, this guy's a man.

00:34:09.547 --> 00:34:13.099
What?
Want me to go find his manners?

00:34:13.742 --> 00:34:15.362
No, I'll take care of it.

00:34:15.869 --> 00:34:18.925
But please get a good look at his face
so he can never enter again.

00:34:18.926 --> 00:34:20.727
We already took care of that.

00:34:20.728 --> 00:34:21.808
First of all

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:25.053
we fired the guy who let him in.

00:34:25.054 --> 00:34:26.676
What are you staring at?

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.247
Geez, this is so annoying.

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.895
Thanks, Philip.

00:35:14.507 --> 00:35:16.446
Alright, let's call it a day.

00:35:16.964 --> 00:35:19.242
I'm going to announce your assignment now.

00:35:19.243 --> 00:35:21.812
- Man...
- I hate this, seriously.

00:35:25.196 --> 00:35:28.093
[First Love Report]
It's the First Love Report.

00:35:29.638 --> 00:35:32.800
Whether it's from a book, movie, webtoon

00:35:32.801 --> 00:35:35.561
or your personal experience

00:35:35.953 --> 00:35:37.643
just define

00:35:37.644 --> 00:35:40.045
what first love means to you
and submit it.

00:35:40.897 --> 00:35:42.017
Ms. Oh!

00:35:42.339 --> 00:35:45.087
"My first love is Ms. Lola."

00:35:45.088 --> 00:35:46.558
Could we write that?

00:35:49.493 --> 00:35:50.516
You can.

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:53.868
But write that at the end

00:35:54.518 --> 00:35:57.055
and explain
why you came to that conclusion.

00:35:57.365 --> 00:35:59.356
So, do you understand?

00:35:59.357 --> 00:36:00.634
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:04.895
I hear the Korean assignment
is a big hit among the sophomores

00:36:04.896 --> 00:36:07.853
and the reason is
because of the First Love Report.

00:36:07.854 --> 00:36:09.055
Hey, Jinho.

00:36:09.056 --> 00:36:11.342
I heard the student teacher
pulled you out of the club.

00:36:12.644 --> 00:36:14.687
Do you see this? Do you?

00:36:15.625 --> 00:36:17.882
I got the chills because
I'm embarrassed for you.

00:36:18.101 --> 00:36:19.434
Get lost.

00:36:20.402 --> 00:36:21.615
You wanna die?

00:36:22.089 --> 00:36:23.213
Crazy bastard.

00:36:23.691 --> 00:36:26.306
Don't get all mad
she put you in your place.

00:36:41.256 --> 00:36:43.092
What should we write
for our First Love Report?

00:36:43.093 --> 00:36:44.773
I don't know, what should we write?

00:36:44.774 --> 00:36:46.190
- Do you have something to write?
- Do you have something to write?

00:36:46.191 --> 00:36:47.254
- You have something, don't you?
- You have nothing!

00:36:47.255 --> 00:36:49.208
- You have something, don't you?
- Do you have something to write?

00:36:49.209 --> 00:36:51.362
You've never even done anything.
What kind of nonsense...

00:36:55.575 --> 00:36:56.763
Guys.

00:36:57.194 --> 00:36:58.681
Wanna see something cool?

00:37:06.748 --> 00:37:08.318
Where'd you get this?

00:37:08.319 --> 00:37:09.617
Don't you want this video?

00:37:12.218 --> 00:37:14.805
I'll send it to our group chat
so you can hold onto it forever.

00:37:14.806 --> 00:37:16.485
- What?
- Lee Jinho.

00:37:17.031 --> 00:37:18.524
Don't cross the line.

00:37:18.933 --> 00:37:20.265
Yeah.

00:37:20.266 --> 00:37:22.689
If the strict ones find out
they'll give Ms. Lola a hard time.

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:24.010
Right?

00:37:24.812 --> 00:37:27.440
They'll give her a hard time.
Right?

00:37:36.276 --> 00:37:37.446
I'll kill you!

00:37:41.764 --> 00:37:44.180
Are you crazy?

00:37:44.181 --> 00:37:45.601
Give it back while I'm asking.

00:37:49.285 --> 00:37:50.949
Geez, seriously!

00:37:56.118 --> 00:37:58.068
Get ready to get slapped.

00:37:59.845 --> 00:38:01.724
- Give it back!
- No, I can't!

00:38:06.144 --> 00:38:07.215
Hold him back!

00:38:10.688 --> 00:38:12.270
- Let go!
- Just delete it!

00:38:12.271 --> 00:38:14.042
- What are you guys doing?
- Hurry up and delete it!

00:38:22.015 --> 00:38:23.125
Let go!

00:38:32.572 --> 00:38:33.856
Take a good look.

00:38:34.504 --> 00:38:36.154
I'm gonna send it right now.

00:38:36.155 --> 00:38:37.612
No, you can't!

00:38:39.495 --> 00:38:40.709
Hey!

00:38:48.604 --> 00:38:50.893
[Would you like to upload the video?]

00:39:06.151 --> 00:39:08.194
Why would you touch my phone?

00:39:08.622 --> 00:39:12.572
You know this is illegal video recording
and distribution, right?

00:39:12.573 --> 00:39:15.221
You could get up to five years in prison
or a fine of 50 million won.

00:39:15.513 --> 00:39:16.721
Can you afford that?

00:39:19.432 --> 00:39:20.999
Are teachers allowed to threaten students?

00:39:21.795 --> 00:39:23.001
Are you afraid?

00:39:23.437 --> 00:39:25.543
Do you understand what you've done now?

00:39:27.582 --> 00:39:28.853
Decide

00:39:29.657 --> 00:39:31.323
whether to delete it yourself

00:39:31.819 --> 00:39:33.435
or to take it to your teacher.

00:39:39.749 --> 00:39:41.413
[The video has been deleted]

00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:44.610
You're so full of yourself.

00:39:54.937 --> 00:39:56.194
Are you okay?

00:40:05.514 --> 00:40:07.449
I know you were trying to help

00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:09.983
but you can't just
take someone's phone and run off.

00:40:11.826 --> 00:40:13.125
I'm sorry.

00:40:13.862 --> 00:40:16.838
But that video...

00:40:18.484 --> 00:40:19.807
Don't worry.

00:40:20.163 --> 00:40:21.720
Jinho won't act out anymore.

00:40:25.242 --> 00:40:27.391
I should've been careful.

00:40:29.315 --> 00:40:30.696
Thank you.

00:40:31.676 --> 00:40:33.868
But don't do anything like that next time.

00:40:34.328 --> 00:40:36.323
You've ruined your cute little face.

00:40:38.743 --> 00:40:40.105
Okay.

00:40:51.009 --> 00:40:52.931
What are you guys doing?

00:40:54.778 --> 00:40:56.082
What do you mean?

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:58.791
We're watching Lee Philip, the man's man.

00:41:01.668 --> 00:41:03.461
What do I tell my mom?

00:41:03.924 --> 00:41:06.410
Just tell her you got hurt
while playing basketball.

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:08.481
I'll back you up if you want.

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.771
Do you like Ms. Lola that much?

00:41:16.018 --> 00:41:17.201
Yeah.

00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:19.126
She said I'm cute.

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.913
You were cool today.

00:41:25.243 --> 00:41:27.205
Yeah, I agree.

00:41:28.724 --> 00:41:30.397
You guys!

00:41:32.058 --> 00:41:33.197
Are you okay?

00:41:34.496 --> 00:41:36.241
Man...

00:41:39.441 --> 00:41:41.511
Whoa! What is this?

00:41:42.091 --> 00:41:43.396
I'm so jealous!

00:41:45.265 --> 00:41:47.634
What's going on?

00:41:59.199 --> 00:42:01.767
This is a crime. A crime!

00:42:03.138 --> 00:42:06.226
It's all because of the angle!

00:42:06.227 --> 00:42:09.447
All I did was treat him
because he got hurt!

00:42:11.131 --> 00:42:13.471
Of course it happened
when the nurse went to the seminar.

00:42:13.472 --> 00:42:14.556
No one saw what happened.

00:42:14.557 --> 00:42:17.597
What if the parents hear about this?

00:42:17.834 --> 00:42:20.761
It's only a matter of time
before the board gets a complaint.

00:42:20.762 --> 00:42:23.182
What are you going to do about this?

00:42:25.236 --> 00:42:28.454
I really didn't do anything wrong!

00:42:28.455 --> 00:42:32.048
All I did was treat his wound.
I'm telling the truth!

00:42:34.077 --> 00:42:36.700
Parents are storming in
and it's a total disaster.

00:42:39.963 --> 00:42:42.564
Ms. Lola, you can see yourself out.

00:42:47.276 --> 00:42:48.394
Okay.

00:43:01.385 --> 00:43:04.797
Isn't that the guy who kissed Ms. Lola?

00:43:05.119 --> 00:43:06.127
Yeah.

00:43:06.128 --> 00:43:07.744
When she was an idol trainee

00:43:07.745 --> 00:43:09.717
I heard she got kicked out
for hitting on someone there

00:43:09.718 --> 00:43:12.306
- but a student? That's just wrong.
- I know, right?

00:43:48.374 --> 00:43:49.873
[Student teacher office]

00:43:58.282 --> 00:43:59.668
What do we do?

00:43:59.669 --> 00:44:01.788
You'll be fired
if you can't prove the truth.

00:44:01.789 --> 00:44:04.725
If you don't meet the required number
of practice days, you'll get an F.

00:44:05.445 --> 00:44:07.360
Then you won't even be able to graduate...

00:44:08.177 --> 00:44:09.415
Then

00:44:10.384 --> 00:44:13.485
I'll retake the course and come back.

00:44:16.102 --> 00:44:18.157
But that won't happen.

00:44:19.031 --> 00:44:22.207
The truth will be revealed.

00:45:01.848 --> 00:45:04.366
Where'd you get
a student teacher like that? Ugh.

00:45:04.367 --> 00:45:07.076
What is this mess?
All because of one student teacher!

00:45:07.322 --> 00:45:11.027
The exams are coming up soon.
What if the kids' grades drop?

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.906
Please, calm down.

00:45:14.268 --> 00:45:16.738
Ms. Lola said...

00:45:16.739 --> 00:45:18.152
Why are you defending her?

00:45:18.304 --> 00:45:20.035
I'm not defending her.

00:45:20.036 --> 00:45:22.702
We still don't know if it's true.

00:45:22.703 --> 00:45:26.088
Isn't it obvious from the video of her
dancing at the club?

00:45:26.089 --> 00:45:27.528
Why are you taking her side?

00:45:27.529 --> 00:45:29.169
Mrs. Lee...

00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:30.763
But...

00:45:30.764 --> 00:45:35.361
There's nothing wrong with an adult
going to dance at a club, is there?

00:45:36.167 --> 00:45:37.270
Geez...

00:45:37.819 --> 00:45:40.378
She's not just an adult!
She's a student teacher!

00:45:40.379 --> 00:45:41.773
Someone who'll become a teacher soon!

00:45:41.774 --> 00:45:42.854
Ma'am.

00:45:44.243 --> 00:45:47.430
She'll only be here for another week.

00:45:47.895 --> 00:45:51.997
If she doesn't finish
she won't be able to graduate.

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:57.946
Please think of her
as a daughter and understand.

00:45:57.947 --> 00:45:59.684
Daughter, my foot...

00:45:59.685 --> 00:46:02.223
I heard she even threatened Jinho.

00:46:02.224 --> 00:46:04.147
- What? She threatened him?
- What?

00:46:04.148 --> 00:46:06.377
I almost pressed charges, but I held back.

00:46:06.378 --> 00:46:08.982
Explain yourself!
What did she do?

00:46:09.412 --> 00:46:11.565
She did what to a child?

00:46:11.566 --> 00:46:14.063
- Explain yourself.
- She threatened a student?

00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:16.510
What is going on? Seriously!

00:46:16.511 --> 00:46:17.826
Explain yourself.

00:46:17.827 --> 00:46:19.796
Guys, it's out of control.

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:24.939
Ms. Lola might actually get fired.

00:46:25.602 --> 00:46:27.129
What? Really?

00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:30.153
- For real?
- Isn't there something we can do?

00:46:30.553 --> 00:46:33.188
- What should we do?
- We need to do something.

00:46:33.419 --> 00:46:34.611
Lee Philip.

00:46:34.946 --> 00:46:37.896
All she did was
apply medication on your lips, right?

00:46:38.754 --> 00:46:41.619
Yeah, that's all she did!
That's the truth!

00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:42.989
Then sue Jinho

00:46:43.791 --> 00:46:46.147
for spreading false rumors and defamation.

00:46:46.745 --> 00:46:49.450
And add emotional damage on there too.

00:46:50.033 --> 00:46:51.470
We'll help you.

00:46:53.708 --> 00:46:54.967
Hey, Kang Hana.

00:46:55.482 --> 00:46:56.836
Shut your mouth.

00:46:57.904 --> 00:47:00.222
Why? Are you scared?

00:47:00.223 --> 00:47:01.856
Sue him? I think that could work.

00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:04.860
Shut up.

00:47:06.307 --> 00:47:07.607
Lee Jinho.

00:47:07.898 --> 00:47:09.766
Come out and say the truth.

00:47:10.017 --> 00:47:11.679
I just took a picture of what I saw.

00:47:12.499 --> 00:47:14.868
We know you
and we know Philip.

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:16.610
You expect us to believe you?

00:47:17.911 --> 00:47:19.146
Hey.

00:47:19.556 --> 00:47:21.933
Are you doing this because you're
embarrassed of what happened with Ms. Oh?

00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:28.282
Do you guys not have eyes?

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:32.238
It's obvious what they did
if you look at the picture!

00:47:40.455 --> 00:47:42.500
Hey, you saw that, right?

00:47:42.936 --> 00:47:45.224
That's the kind of person Jinho is.

00:47:45.438 --> 00:47:47.805
So talk to your parents and sue him.

00:47:48.249 --> 00:47:49.700
That's our best bet.

00:48:03.976 --> 00:48:05.109
Ms. Lola.

00:48:06.346 --> 00:48:07.501
I'm sorry.

00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:10.146
I'll take care of it.

00:48:10.147 --> 00:48:12.170
If I report Jinho to the police...

00:48:12.171 --> 00:48:13.327
Report?

00:48:14.151 --> 00:48:16.314
Yes, I'm going to talk to my parents

00:48:16.315 --> 00:48:19.062
and report him for
spreading false rumors and defamation.

00:48:20.394 --> 00:48:23.691
That would make Jinho a criminal, though.

00:48:27.989 --> 00:48:31.218
Let's give Jinho some time.

00:48:31.905 --> 00:48:34.044
Jinho will never tell the truth!

00:48:34.045 --> 00:48:35.583
- So...
- Philip.

00:48:44.386 --> 00:48:45.626
Philip.

00:49:02.247 --> 00:49:06.514
Will you let me take care of this?

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:09.756
What if you get fired in the process?

00:49:12.242 --> 00:49:16.569
Then you won't be able to graduate.

00:49:19.254 --> 00:49:20.558
Philip.

00:49:22.850 --> 00:49:27.455
Jinho is also a student of mine.

00:49:36.293 --> 00:49:38.173
What do I do now?

00:49:42.906 --> 00:49:47.037
What you mean?
Just spread the club video.

00:49:47.038 --> 00:49:49.098
You said Jinho was caught in your vlog.

00:49:49.409 --> 00:49:52.520
I can't ruin a little kid's future
just to save myself.

00:49:53.676 --> 00:49:55.265
As for graduation

00:49:56.195 --> 00:49:57.763
I can just do that next year.

00:49:58.368 --> 00:50:00.185
Are you dumb?

00:50:00.907 --> 00:50:02.180
Hey.

00:50:02.181 --> 00:50:03.524
If you just leave like this

00:50:03.525 --> 00:50:05.554
you'll be the student teacher who got
wrapped up in a scandal with a student.

00:50:05.555 --> 00:50:07.643
There's no way people
who make money off students will hire you!

00:50:09.689 --> 00:50:11.280
I thought you wanted to
become a star instructor!

00:50:11.559 --> 00:50:13.783
That's why you went to Daechi-dong
to TA while you were in college.

00:50:13.784 --> 00:50:15.032
Isn't that such a waste?

00:50:19.407 --> 00:50:21.113
Is this how my dream

00:50:21.853 --> 00:50:23.836
of becoming a star instructor
goes up in smoke?

00:50:37.707 --> 00:50:40.835
Lola, give it another thought.

00:50:41.393 --> 00:50:42.933
I'm sorry.

00:50:43.357 --> 00:50:45.303
Why are you running away?
It's so unlike you.

00:50:46.169 --> 00:50:47.999
If the truth doesn't come out

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.611
the rumors will stick to you
as if they're true.

00:50:51.316 --> 00:50:52.519
Are you okay with that?

00:50:54.250 --> 00:50:56.213
While working as a student teacher

00:50:57.109 --> 00:51:00.288
I think I came to like this job a little.

00:51:01.882 --> 00:51:04.020
That's enough for me.

00:51:11.926 --> 00:51:14.973
This is happening because
you're being so wishy-washy!

00:51:15.603 --> 00:51:17.229
Geez...

00:51:23.256 --> 00:51:25.154
Ms. Lola is quitting.

00:51:33.114 --> 00:51:35.578
Philip, you didn't sue?

00:51:58.006 --> 00:51:59.454
You want to get beat up again?

00:51:59.470 --> 00:52:01.433
Do you know why I didn't report you?

00:52:01.434 --> 00:52:03.633
She said
even someone like you was her student!

00:52:03.634 --> 00:52:06.042
She said she didn't
want you to become a criminal!

00:52:32.886 --> 00:52:35.292
I spent all night making these.

00:52:35.293 --> 00:52:36.712
Pretty touching, right?

00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:45.395
I'm sorry I decided to quit

00:52:46.074 --> 00:52:48.634
but I've taken away
something very special thanks to you.

00:52:49.227 --> 00:52:50.515
Thank you.

00:52:54.049 --> 00:52:55.379
What did you take away?

00:52:56.047 --> 00:52:59.511
That school is a very fun and nice place.

00:53:01.435 --> 00:53:04.796
So, I'm going to try again next year.

00:53:04.797 --> 00:53:06.002
Really?

00:53:06.003 --> 00:53:08.261
You're really coming back?

00:53:08.262 --> 00:53:11.313
- You have to promise us!
- Okay.

00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:15.630
So, since I'm so grateful to all of you

00:53:16.416 --> 00:53:18.071
I'm going to say something cringey.

00:53:18.072 --> 00:53:19.921
Bear with me, okay?

00:53:19.922 --> 00:53:21.317
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:53:22.564 --> 00:53:25.310
"A student shines brightest
when they're just being a student."

00:53:25.717 --> 00:53:27.275
You've heard that, right?

00:53:27.276 --> 00:53:28.332
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:53:29.095 --> 00:53:33.244
I hated hearing those words
when I was your age too

00:53:33.911 --> 00:53:35.931
but I realized after some time.

00:53:36.769 --> 00:53:37.892
It was a privilege.

00:53:38.561 --> 00:53:41.900
A privilege you can
only enjoy at this time.

00:53:43.293 --> 00:53:44.978
Right now

00:53:44.979 --> 00:53:48.853
you're at an age where your very presence
makes you beautiful and radiant.

00:53:49.527 --> 00:53:54.217
So, it's okay
if you're still figuring things out.

00:53:56.295 --> 00:53:59.113
Whether it's friendship or academics...

00:53:59.498 --> 00:54:01.351
You can build it up little by little.

00:54:01.744 --> 00:54:04.443
Learning and growing up like that

00:54:05.815 --> 00:54:07.665
is the privilege you have.

00:54:11.088 --> 00:54:14.627
So, I hope you enjoy
your privileges to the fullest.

00:54:15.256 --> 00:54:16.368
Okay?

00:54:16.861 --> 00:54:17.990
- Okay!
- Okay!

00:54:29.791 --> 00:54:30.814
What?

00:54:32.882 --> 00:54:34.625
I really didn't want to give this to you

00:54:35.503 --> 00:54:37.496
but Ms. Lola told me to, so here.

00:54:54.026 --> 00:54:55.904
Come to think of it

00:54:56.182 --> 00:54:59.020
I think I came across a bit too harsh
almost like I was threatening you.

00:54:59.870 --> 00:55:01.537
But Jinho

00:55:02.054 --> 00:55:07.520
it was my first time being a teacher
so I was rough around the edges.

00:55:08.517 --> 00:55:10.674
Will you please forgive me?

00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:14.919
If we ever run into each other

00:55:15.411 --> 00:55:17.186
let's say hi with a smile.

00:55:17.866 --> 00:55:19.133
From Ms. Lola.

00:55:47.857 --> 00:55:49.463
Philip.

00:55:49.464 --> 00:55:53.209
I told you to find your dreams
in your heart, not your head, right?

00:55:54.477 --> 00:55:57.292
I think I've finally found
what I want to do too.

00:55:58.633 --> 00:56:00.623
After meeting you guys

00:56:00.624 --> 00:56:03.381
I figured out what I really love to do.

00:56:04.515 --> 00:56:08.735
I want to become a teacher
not an instructor.

00:56:10.346 --> 00:56:12.560
That's why I chose the best option.

00:56:13.628 --> 00:56:17.152
So don't feel guilty over something
that's not your responsibility.

00:56:17.153 --> 00:56:20.728
I hope you can explore a variety of things
so you can figure out what your dream is.

00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:23.604
If I'm lucky enough

00:56:23.975 --> 00:56:26.488
to come back here next year

00:56:27.133 --> 00:56:29.323
then let's meet
as better versions of ourselves.

00:56:30.588 --> 00:56:31.859
And

00:56:32.448 --> 00:56:33.821
thank you

00:56:34.838 --> 00:56:37.905
for helping me find my true dream.

00:56:41.530 --> 00:56:44.522
Ms. Lola, thank you.

00:56:45.587 --> 00:56:49.512
I'm grateful that someone
as amazing as you is my first love.

00:57:16.177 --> 00:57:17.477
Ms. Lola!

00:57:22.915 --> 00:57:24.675
See you next year!

00:57:28.595 --> 00:57:29.790
- See you.
- See you.

00:57:29.791 --> 00:57:31.941
- See you next year!
- See you next year!

00:57:38.689 --> 00:57:42.909
Just like that
my first love, Ms. Lola, left.

00:57:44.409 --> 00:57:47.272
Though my first love ended in failure

00:57:47.867 --> 00:57:52.060
it was a eureka moment for me.

00:57:53.197 --> 00:57:55.629
Just like Columbus
discovered the New World

00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:59.257
I discovered that I had
a man's pure love in me too.

00:58:01.987 --> 00:58:05.621
Just as Ms. Lola said
I'm going to enjoy the privilege of youth.

00:58:05.622 --> 00:58:08.151
I'm going to you, like this.

00:58:08.152 --> 00:58:09.681
The wrist is the key.

00:58:09.682 --> 00:58:13.697
Because if I do, I'll be able to
discover another side of myself.

00:58:38.718 --> 00:58:41.652
[First Love]

00:58:44.083 --> 00:58:46.466
Why do you think our school
keeps having power outages?

00:58:46.467 --> 00:58:47.893
But that ghost grandma...

00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:52.521
smiled creepily.

00:58:56.296 --> 00:58:58.266
Aw, is the little baby scared?

00:58:58.267 --> 00:59:00.213
Who would believe something like that?

00:59:00.214 --> 00:59:03.083
What would you say
if your friend asks you out?

00:59:03.084 --> 00:59:06.042
We haven't even started dating yet
so why worry about it already?

00:59:06.362 --> 00:59:07.431
Here.

00:59:07.432 --> 00:59:09.421
If we break up, it'll be awkward...

00:59:09.422 --> 00:59:10.891
Let's just be friends.

00:59:10.892 --> 00:59:14.226
What if Jun-young
never wants to see me again?

00:59:14.227 --> 00:59:15.842
I have to figure this out.

00:59:15.843 --> 00:59:17.715
It's better not to start at all

00:59:17.716 --> 00:59:19.198
than to waste time and emotions.

00:59:21.124 --> 00:59:22.698
- The ghost grandma...
- Hey, Kim Ina!

00:59:32.701 --> 00:59:34.042
Jun-young!
