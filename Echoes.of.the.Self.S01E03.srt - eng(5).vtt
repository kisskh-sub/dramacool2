[Echoes of the Self]

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.870
Princess Fu Wei,

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.060
why are you here?

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.910
Why did you lie?

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.810
Why betray your mother?

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.270
Why do things you'd regret?

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.700
In what capacity are you
speaking to me like this?

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.820
As the noble Princess of Daqing

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.190
or as my cousin whom I've never met?

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.370
I know Madam Cui has been
oppressing you all these years.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.520
But however hard and dangerous it's been,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.760
you shouldn't betray your own mother.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.680
Don't you know

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.440
the risk of

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.289
bargaining with a tiger?

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:21.890
Everyone understands that.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.480
But does knowing that

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.310
actually help people survive

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.910
or help them rise to power?

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.320
I can protect you.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.280
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.479
But you're here
for a political marriage.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.720
You may protect us today,

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.340
but once you leave the Zhou's Mansion,

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.289
how will my mother and I survive here?

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.200
My mother needs more rest.

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.890
Please leave, Your Highness.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.960
Perhaps I shouldn't blame my past self
who's been lost in confusion

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.840
and unable to find a way out.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.610
I need to figure everything out quickly

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:11.520
and find a way

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.390
to take Mother and Xi away.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.360
Your Highness,

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.579
your ginseng soup is here.

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:24.240
Don't move.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.670
What are you really after?

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.950
Why make me impersonate the Princess?

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.090
Your Highness,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.460
what are you doing?

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.630
You are the Princess of Daqing.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.500
Still won't tell the truth?

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.160
Then don't blame me for showing no mercy.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.960
I'll tell you.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.640
That day when you collapsed
by the roadside,

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.320
Princess saved you.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.850
When you woke up, you were confused

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.320
and had forgotten
everything that happened in your past.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.790
Your appearance happens
to be similar to Princess's,

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:56.910
so Princess

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.210
had you take her place.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.690
Your Princess want me
to die in her place?

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.770
Princess simply didn't want
this political marriage.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.840
The encounter with bandits
at the posthouse that day

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.110
was truly an accident.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.110
Princess knew nothing about it.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.630
Where is Princess now?

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.320
I don't know.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.670
It's just that...

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.000
Princess told me to keep an eye on you.

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.370
Princess and I are not the same person.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.680
How can I replace her?

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.920
The women of the Daqing royal family

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.320
all wear veils in public.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.050
Except for their personal servants,

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.860
no one knows what they look like.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.410
Besides,
Princess has the marriage documents.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.010
As long as I stay with you,

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.010
you are the Princess.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.360
Your name is Linglan, right?

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.730
From now on, you'll follow me.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.520
However your princess treated you before,

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.840
that's how I'll treat you.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.360
But if you dare tell anyone
about this impersonation,

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.829
I won't spare your life.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.230
Yes.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.710
Given how things stand,

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.070
I have to take advantage of
the identity of Princess of Daqing,

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.270
so that I won't repeat the same mistake.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:10.290
Your Highness,

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.780
do you mean to take my life?

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.830
How do the guards in the royal escort team

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.110
compare to you

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.380
in martial arts?

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.440
I've heard

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.519
that Daqing's warriors
are all top-notch fighters.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:20.579
Their martial arts

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.480
are certainly better than mine.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.240
They were all top-notch fighters,

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.740
yet they were killed with a single strike,

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.670
without even signs of resistance.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.150
This clearly shows

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.600
how formidable the killer is.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.470
But

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.640
who would dare

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.210
to assassinate the princess
sent for marriage alliance?

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.740
This could seriously affect
relations between the two states.

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:47.580
Father,

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.460
I believe

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.270
we must not agree to
Daqing's marriage alliance.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.400
Your Highness,

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.060
since Daqing has shown goodwill,

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.700
why resort to conflict?

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:56.530
Lord Liu,

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.140
a temporary war

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:59.880
is to secure lasting peace.

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:01.470
Don't you understand that?

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.080
Regarding this marriage alliance,

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.660
I believe

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.900
the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.750
This matter needs no further discussion.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.770
Your Majesty is wise.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.470
This matter is indeed complicated.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.910
I must find out who's behind this.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:25.770
Your Highness,

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.500
we can't find any more clues
from those dead bodies.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.340
What should we

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:30.460
do next?

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.010
Since we can't find more clues

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.260
from the dead,

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.610
we must look among the living.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.470
[Zhou's Mansion]

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.720
She seems somewhat similar

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.710
to the person in my dreams.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.159
Yan.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.180
Prince Yan.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:01.660
Princess.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.260
The old wound on your left arm
is acting up again.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.600
How did she know?

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.770
And why does she care so much?

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.400
Have we met before?

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:20.590
No.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.020
If we've never met,

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:24.270
then why

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.380
do you

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.760
know so much

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.430
about Yunrui's affairs?

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.970
You must have carefully arranged

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.500
for this marriage alliance

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.659
and have a chosen husband in mind.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.159
Are you suggesting

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.300
that my carefully selected future husband

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.240
is you?

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:46.750
Could it be

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.100
she wants to marry me?

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.940
I not only know about
your left arm injury,

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.200
but I also know

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.470
that the Crown Prince's
childhood sweetheart

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:55.970
is the eldest daughter of the Zhou family,

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.620
and even what kind of women
His Majesty prefers.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.750
Doesn't that make me more suspicious?

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.790
I came here for a marriage alliance.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.460
What's so weird about
understanding the personalities

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.110
and preferences of the royal family?

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:11.930
Do I have to wait until the veil is lifted

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.200
in the bridal sedan

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.510
to find out who I'm marrying?

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:17.670
It seems

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.270
I overthought this.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.060
Regarding the incident at the posthouse,

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.210
I have sent people
to investigate it thoroughly.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:25.130
Except for you

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:26.590
and your maid Linglan,

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.350
everyone else

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:29.960
was killed by the bandits,

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.170
with no survivors.

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:34.000
But Princess,

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.020
why don't you show any grief?

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:39.050
How

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.340
should grief be shown?

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.320
They were all loyal servants

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.120
who accompanied me throughout the journey.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.380
Now that they're dead,

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:47.920
what I can do

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.020
is not to wallow in self-pity,

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.960
but to seek justice for them.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:53.580
Prince Yan,

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:54.900
isn't that right?

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.520
But the assassins
weren't some ordinary bandits,

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.440
but highly skilled martial artists.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.580
It seems everything

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.390
was carefully premeditated.

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:03.540
Premeditated?

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.000
Could it be that Princess of Daqing's
death in the previous life

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.460
wasn't an accident at all?

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.720
Princess,

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.110
have you thought of something?

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:14.340
There was nothing

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.920
unusual along the way.

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:18.310
If you have the ability,

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:20.590
you can investigate yourself.

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:21.110
But...

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:22.580
Did you come today

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.130
to interrogate a prisoner?

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:27.170
I'm here to take you to the
Court of Imperial Sacrifices

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:28.310
for registration.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:31.250
The carriage is ready.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.580
Please, Princess.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:44.760
Don't touch it.

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:47.170
It hurts.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:48.470
Mother,

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:51.030
how did you get hurt so badly?

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.200
If you

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:53.800
hadn't come back,

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.480
I'd have been beaten to death.

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:56.610
Every day

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.840
you think about
being with the Crown Prince.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.160
How could you care about my safety?

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.360
I went to the mountains to gather herbs.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.490
His Highness was worried about my safety,

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.130
so he accompanied me.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.520
His Highness truly cares for you.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.400
You must not disappoint
his sincere feelings.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.000
In my opinion,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.460
you should

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:17.970
get married soon,

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.360
and put my mind at ease.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.180
His Highness truly cares for me.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.210
Does that mean I must marry him?

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:27.540
When His Highness becomes Emperor one day,

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.070
he will surely have
thousands of concubines.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.080
I don't want to fight over a man
with a crowd of women.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:33.870
Foolish!

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:36.880
Mother,

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:38.170
please rest well.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.600
You're really confused!

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.380
So many women are eagerly pursuing

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:45.290
that position of Empress above thousands.

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:46.330
Only you

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.640
fail to see its value.

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:49.600
We already had those two,
mother and daughter, at home

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.660
who were eyesores.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.300
Now suddenly a Daqing Princess shows up,

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.040
and your father takes her side.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.960
He listened to her,

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:00.910
and even punished me.

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:02.450
Yao,

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:04.910
you must put more effort into this.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.630
If you don't try harder,

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.060
His Highness will be taken
by someone else.

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.050
Someone who can be taken away

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:12.860
isn't truly devoted.

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:14.900
I don't care about that.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.880
By the way, Mother.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.790
Princess of Daqing has a noble status

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:23.290
and is also Madam Wang's distant relative.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.040
If you keep opposing her,

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:27.310
aren't you just asking for trouble?

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:28.880
In my opinion,

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:31.900
you shouldn't take
everything so seriously.

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:47.090
Madam.

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:48.360
[Cicada Notebook]

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:53.850
Ruoxi, you're here.

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:55.570
Big Mother,

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:56.940
you wanted to see me?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.530
Well, Ruoxi,

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.170
I have

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:01.720
truly underestimated you.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:03.950
To save your mother,

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.040
you were even willing
to abandon your maternal family.

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:08.880
Did you summon me

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.210
just to talk about this?

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:12.040
Of course not.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.720
I'm here to give you

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.440
and your mother

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:18.030
a way to survive.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.390
I want that Princess of Daqing

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:25.570
gone from this world.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.780
You want to hire someone to kill her?

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.320
What price are you offering?

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:35.850
Have you picked the wrong person?

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.720
What if

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.890
it's your mother's life at stake?

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.480
I wonder if you think

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.730
that's enough.

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:53.650
This poison mixed in tea

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.210
has a fragrant aroma

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.660
and a lingering taste.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.590
The symptoms of poisoning

00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:59.070
resemble tuberculosis.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:11:59.920
At best,

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.320
she'll be bedridden.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:01.930
At worst,

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.420
she won't survive.

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:06.770
You are cousins.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.640
You'll have plenty of opportunities.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:14.420
Of course,

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:16.550
if you're unwilling,

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.650
I certainly won't force you.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.520
It's just

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:21.300
a pity.

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:24.060
Your mother

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:25.850
is already frail,

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.920
and now she's been beaten.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:30.740
Who knows

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.060
how many days she has left?

00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:59.080
Mother,

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:01.570
I'm well aware of

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.680
Madam Cui's wicked intentions.

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:06.440
She simply wants to use me

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:08.100
to poison Princess Fu Wei

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:10.560
to eliminate her threat

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:12.610
and then place all

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:13.970
the blame on me.

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:16.710
Killing two birds with one stone.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:25.570
Mother.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:29.060
If anything happens to me,

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:32.170
please don't worry,

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.520
and don't blame me.

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:47.100
The current Princess Fu Wei is fake?

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.080
Yes.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.340
Master, do you want me to kill her?

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.140
No.

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:53.570
Hold your position

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:55.170
and wait for my instructions.

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:55.970
Master,

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:56.880
I...

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.720
It's time now.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:13:59.770
Take it.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.020
Thank you, Master.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.280
Xi,

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:27.350
come with me.

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:30.290
What are you doing?

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:31.310
I should be asking you.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:32.360
What are you going to do?

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.020
I'm bringing ginseng tea to Big Mother

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.870
to apologize for offending her earlier.

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:37.610
Your Highness, why are you so nervous?

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:39.320
Are you really apologizing to her

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.780
or setting a trap yourself

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:42.010
to frame her?

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.490
I don't understand what you mean.

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:54.720
You suspect I'm poisoning Big Mother?

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.020
You're planning to poison yourself.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:13.240
You know
with Madam Cui's suspicion of you,

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.310
you can't easily poison her.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.370
So you can only poison yourself

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.160
and then frame her for it.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:23.840
Big Mother...

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.280
How cruel of you.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.280
You've poisoned me.

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.370
You wretched girl!

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.180
How dare you frame Madam!

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.810
About this poisoning incident,

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:42.340
let's just forget about it.

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:43.920
Take care of yourself.

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:45.400
Father—

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.370
I said,

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.060
forget it.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.020
Even if you're willing to risk your life

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:54.340
to drag her down with you,

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.030
you should understand that

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:58.860
in this Zhou's Mansion,

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:00.870
no one will protect you

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:02.940
or help you.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:04.450
Your life

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.890
means absolutely nothing.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.960
Even if I know this is
like a moth to a flame,

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:16.850
it's the only plan I could think of.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.780
Your Highness, do you know

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:19.660
this poison

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.660
was originally meant for your tea,
on Madam Cui's order?

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:24.790
She wanted to kill you by my hand.

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:27.450
Do you have any

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.720
other option besides desperate measures?

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.080
Neither of us will die.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.600
Your Highness, what brings you here today?

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.120
Mrs. Zhou,

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:59.910
today Xi brought me some new tea.

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:03.290
Since I've been disturbing you
here for so long,

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:04.560
I thought

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:07.270
I'd bring it to you as a small gift.

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:09.579
This tea was brought by Ruoxi?

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:10.740
Yes.

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:12.240
Mrs. Zhou,

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:13.160
please try it.

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:15.670
Alright.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.099
Xi said

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:22.210
this tea

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:23.720
has a wonderful aroma

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.310
and a lingering aftertaste.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:27.040
Please have a taste, Mrs. Zhou.

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:33.600
Recently,

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.140
I've been feeling unsettled

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:36.020
and can't sleep

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:37.170
at night.

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:38.520
The doctor said

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:40.650
I shouldn't drink strong tea.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.880
Can't sleep at night?

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.560
Could it be

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:49.930
you've done something unconscionable
to harm someone's life?

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.790
I was just joking.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:59.950
There's no need to be so nervous.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.610
It's just that

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:05.520
this tea

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:07.340
is what I

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.460
have bestowed upon you.

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:11.120
So you

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.340
must drink it.
