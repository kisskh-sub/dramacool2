00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:50.208
(Oh no.)

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.584
(I made a mistake.)

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.180
The way you are right now

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.939
looks nothing like your usual self.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.540
Now that you're in my grasp,

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.180
I'd like to see

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.299
what your true self

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:06.659
is.

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:20.320
What do you want?

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:22.144
Get off me.

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:24.659
Sir, don't rush to drive me away.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.180
I'm right here before you,

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.020
what are you waiting for?

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:17.900
To restrain yourself,

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.699
you sealed your acupoints?

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.020
Do you think this solves it?

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.264
Let me tell you.

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:29.120
You are

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.340
even easier to be controlled.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.340
(His eyes clearly showed
infatuation with me,)

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.259
(yet he'd rather harm himself
than touch me.)

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.139
(Other men would've
lost control long ago.)

00:03:48.032 --> 00:03:50.919
Today, if we can capture that woman,

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:53.056
the bounty money will all be ours.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:54.819
Since you reject me,

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:56.580
then I won't help you.

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:07.744
Lad,

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:10.199
did you see a woman
dressed like a dancer?

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:11.264
Where did she go?

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.192
Keep silence?

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:21.360
He's really suspicious.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.920
Could he be that woman in disguise?

00:04:24.384 --> 00:04:25.319
Senior.

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:26.399
Show him what you got.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.872
Okay.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.899
Heaven and Earth, halt!

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.519
(These two)

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.160
(are utterly losers.)

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.560
That woman has some skills.

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:41.856
My turn.

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:54.688
Junior.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.319
We must use our ultimate move.

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.379
- Run! Run!
- We can't win this fight.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.019
(After playing all these tricks,)

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:29.939
(do you think you can escape?)

00:05:31.904 --> 00:05:32.896
Stop!

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.620
E-Everything just now
was those Daoists' doing.

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:41.740
None of my business.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:42.600
What?

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.199
You're blaming their mistakes on me?

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.184
No explanations needed.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.139
You enjoy seducing with beauty, right?

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.360
You have to vow

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.439
that you'll never harm anyone's life.

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:55.439
If you break this vow,

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.259
you will be hideous.

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:11.600
Fine.

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:16.360
I, Bai Chuli, hereby vow

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.519
that if I commit any wicked deeds,

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:21.120
I'll be hideous.

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:23.424
Satisfied now?

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:28.720
Remember what you said today.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.319
What I do

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.736
isn't for you to decide.

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:53.319
(To restrain yourself,)

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:55.079
(you sealed your acupoints?)

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:05.959
That immortal truly differs
from other vulgar men.

00:07:09.519 --> 00:07:11.720
Pity I still don't know his name.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.120
I need to find a way to meet him again.

00:07:24.064 --> 00:07:25.480
Don't come closer! Stay back!

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.496
I won't do it again.

00:07:26.496 --> 00:07:27.639
I won't do it again. Never!

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:29.480
Weren't you trying to harass me?

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.624
What now?

00:07:30.752 --> 00:07:32.279
Sorry! Spare me!

00:07:32.279 --> 00:07:33.439
Please spare me!

00:07:40.519 --> 00:07:42.656
Since that strange lad ruined our plans

00:07:42.656 --> 00:07:43.552
last time,

00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:45.160
so many days have passed,

00:07:45.519 --> 00:07:47.319
yet we haven't seen that woman again.

00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:51.959
They say the Night Clan women
seduce men with beauty.

00:07:52.399 --> 00:07:53.720
Why don't we disguise ourselves

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.240
as charming scholars?

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.600
Good idea.

00:07:58.519 --> 00:08:01.120
They say that woman
is a peerless beauty.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.579
Let's flirt with her
before capturing her.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.399
Are you looking for me?

00:08:11.648 --> 00:08:12.519
You...

00:08:12.519 --> 00:08:13.376
What?

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.920
Stunned by my beauty?

00:08:17.839 --> 00:08:18.816
What?

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:20.720
Your beauty?

00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:22.848
How dare you!

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.399
I am stunningly beautiful.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.360
How dare you to say nonsense?

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:30.759
Doubt my beauty?

00:08:42.519 --> 00:08:44.120
I left your corpses intact.

00:08:44.799 --> 00:08:46.720
Be grateful!

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.000
No one has ever doubted my beauty.

00:08:54.919 --> 00:08:56.519
I, Bai Chuli, hereby vow

00:08:56.879 --> 00:08:58.919
that if I commit any wicked deeds,

00:09:00.279 --> 00:09:01.879
I'll be hideous.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.928
Impossible.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.040
Impossible.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.352
Look at her.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.779
What's on her face? Terrifying.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:24.919
That's terrifying.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:25.980
She looks like this.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.440
What? Say it again if you dare!

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.120
That's terrifying.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.259
What does she want?

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.440
What's terrifying?

00:09:33.539 --> 00:09:34.919
You are. You are terrifying.

00:09:34.919 --> 00:09:36.352
Men feel disgusted approaching you.

00:09:36.352 --> 00:09:37.659
Children run away seeing you.

00:09:37.659 --> 00:09:39.019
Stop ruining our business.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.460
Madam.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.120
Madam.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.080
Madam.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.799
Madam.

00:09:56.799 --> 00:09:57.760
What's going on?

00:10:01.759 --> 00:10:02.720
Why would she...

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.440
It's no use.

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:17.840
You brought back
less and less vital energy.

00:10:18.039 --> 00:10:19.919
Madam had been starving

00:10:20.039 --> 00:10:21.519
and forbade me from telling you.

00:10:21.639 --> 00:10:22.879
Just now, she...

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.159
If my face were fine,

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.120
I would get men's vital energy.

00:10:35.759 --> 00:10:36.639
It's all my fault.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.120
She asked me to give this to you.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.200
She said when you're severely injured,

00:10:50.519 --> 00:10:52.480
this can protect you.

00:10:55.039 --> 00:10:56.120
The supreme treasure,

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.279
Coldwood Origin Stone.

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:01.184
But

00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:05.039
it couldn't save her life.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.000
(When time goes by,)

00:11:11.559 --> 00:11:13.879
(will I die like her too?)

00:11:14.879 --> 00:11:16.032
Bai Chuli!

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.600
You feeble weaklings

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.960
have been staying here for long.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.519
Now some are dead, others weakened.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.440
Maybe you guys should move out.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.032
Pah!

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.399
The Spiritual Spring
belongs to Madam and Ling

00:11:30.919 --> 00:11:33.200
for sheltering
homeless Night Clan people.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.679
Try to seize this place?

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:35.919
Shameless!

00:11:37.919 --> 00:11:40.519
The winner takes all.

00:11:40.759 --> 00:11:42.120
The strong devour the weak.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.256
Bai Chuli,

00:11:44.559 --> 00:11:46.440
you're hideous now.

00:11:47.399 --> 00:11:48.879
You can't protect them anymore.

00:11:49.879 --> 00:11:51.600
Stop trying to be bold.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.360
Why are you here?

00:12:42.759 --> 00:12:43.840
You've been following me?

00:13:17.679 --> 00:13:19.240
Seeing me like this

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.519
satisfies you, right?

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.480
I'd rather you kill me with your sword!

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.600
I didn't make you this way.

00:13:28.919 --> 00:13:30.480
You broke

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.520
your own vow.

00:13:33.559 --> 00:13:34.919
The men I harmed

00:13:35.559 --> 00:13:37.240
had several wives at home,

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.799
yet they still

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.759
sought other women.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.279
Some even abused women.

00:13:44.759 --> 00:13:46.720
If they hadn't lusted after my beauty,

00:13:46.919 --> 00:13:48.600
I couldn't have lured them.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.759
If they could act like you,

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.399
could I harm anyone?

00:13:52.879 --> 00:13:53.919
Are you suggesting

00:13:54.759 --> 00:13:55.919
you did nothing wrong?

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:57.539
No.

00:13:58.759 --> 00:13:59.919
What pains me is,

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.720
I've never harmed you,

00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:07.120
yet you wanted to kill me for those men.

00:14:08.919 --> 00:14:09.840
Be reasonable.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.240
When did I want to kill you?

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.759
You made me like this.

00:14:13.759 --> 00:14:16.480
It's like killing me!

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.600
Even now,

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.759
I still don't know your name.

00:15:07.879 --> 00:15:09.279
Want to know my name?

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.168
Of course.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.679
You're the most handsome immortal

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.639
and the most tricky one I've met.

00:15:21.399 --> 00:15:22.279
My name is Wan Guchen.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.360
Wan Guchen?

00:15:27.799 --> 00:15:29.159
That name sounds familiar.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.120
You're the War God of Nine Heavens,

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:39.399
Wan Guchen?

00:15:43.799 --> 00:15:45.519
No wonder you are so formidable

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.320
and always ruin my plans.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.360
What?

00:15:51.679 --> 00:15:52.608
Are you scared now?

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.559
You're the War God,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.799
while I'm like this...

00:16:02.799 --> 00:16:04.360
Focus on your own problem first.

00:16:15.559 --> 00:16:16.480
You two stay here,

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.960
in case they come again.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.088
Why

00:16:30.279 --> 00:16:32.360
does this place feel so familiar?

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.120
Don't

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.320
look at my face.

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.344
What are you...?

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.320
I transfer my vital energy to you.

00:17:01.159 --> 00:17:02.360
Stop harming others.

00:17:08.256 --> 00:17:11.104
(Falling Snow)

00:17:27.759 --> 00:17:29.000
Chuli.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.519
Why hasn't Wan Guchen come anymore?

00:17:35.599 --> 00:17:36.608
I don't know.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.599
But I haven't gone hungry
these past days.

00:17:40.799 --> 00:17:43.279
He must come secretly at night
while we sleep

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.119
to give us his vital energy.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.359
Why doesn't he come meet us?

00:17:50.599 --> 00:17:51.584
Ling.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.359
Let's leave this place.

00:17:53.759 --> 00:17:55.680
Why?

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.640
I want to see
if he'll come looking for me.

00:18:01.359 --> 00:18:02.240
Okay.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:03.808
Let's go.

00:18:27.359 --> 00:18:28.880
Chuli, be careful.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.136
I'm okay.

00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:36.039
Chuli.

00:18:36.039 --> 00:18:37.119
Your...

00:18:37.119 --> 00:18:38.440
Your face...

00:18:48.539 --> 00:18:49.728
Wan Guchen!

00:18:50.019 --> 00:18:51.104
Wan Guchen!

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:53.539
I know it's you.

00:18:54.619 --> 00:18:56.339
Why did you restore my beauty,

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:57.740
yet refuse to meet me?

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:01.559
Since you won't meet me,

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.640
I'll come find you.

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:26.112
War God,

00:19:26.299 --> 00:19:27.168
you're back.

00:19:27.539 --> 00:19:29.420
The Immortal Lord
asked you to go meet him.

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:31.808
Understood.

00:19:37.299 --> 00:19:38.900
Why did you summon me?

00:19:44.579 --> 00:19:46.500
I need to remind you

00:19:47.259 --> 00:19:49.460
not to neglect your duties.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.500
As the Sword Master of Nine Heavens,

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:53.859
I'll do my best naturally.

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:55.980
Don't worry about it.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.220
Yet she has come to you.

00:20:04.539 --> 00:20:05.460
War God.

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.700
Time to take action.

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.079
I won't harm her.

00:20:14.579 --> 00:20:15.779
In that case,

00:20:15.779 --> 00:20:19.740
I'll personally deal with her.

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.168
Wait!

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:25.539
I am here for someone.

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:26.980
Don't try to stop me!

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:31.619
So bold!

00:20:32.019 --> 00:20:34.019
You are causing trouble here?

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:37.059
I really admire your courage.

00:20:38.019 --> 00:20:40.819
You are the Immortal Lord
of Nine Heavens?

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:42.912
Exactly.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:44.896
Perfect timing.

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:46.220
I'm here for Wan Guchen.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.180
You didn't come for me,

00:20:48.819 --> 00:20:50.460
but I came for you.

00:20:52.019 --> 00:20:53.539
For the safety of Three Realms,

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.420
I have to end your life here.

00:20:57.579 --> 00:20:58.619
Old man.

00:20:58.819 --> 00:20:59.859
Why being so unreasonable?

00:21:00.579 --> 00:21:01.660
I'm just here for someone.

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:03.339
Why end my life for this?

00:21:04.099 --> 00:21:05.539
Blame yourself

00:21:05.859 --> 00:21:07.539
for being born into this world.

00:21:08.019 --> 00:21:08.992
Stop!

00:21:17.696 --> 00:21:18.688
Wan Guchen.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:20.579
You finally came.

00:21:22.019 --> 00:21:23.072
You shouldn't be here.

00:21:25.339 --> 00:21:26.339
Since you're here,

00:21:26.779 --> 00:21:28.460
then fulfill your duty.

00:21:29.339 --> 00:21:31.019
She shouldn't exist in this world.

00:21:31.779 --> 00:21:33.779
As the Sword Master of Nine Heavens,

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:35.779
if you defend her,

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:39.180
what would the masses think?

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:49.460
With me here today,

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.339
no one can harm her.

00:21:57.619 --> 00:21:59.299
You know who she is.

00:22:00.619 --> 00:22:02.180
Even if she has not awakened,

00:22:02.859 --> 00:22:04.700
she's still one of Night Clan,

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.740
a scourge of all Three Realms,
and must be eliminated.

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:11.259
I expect you
to understand the importance

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.460
and tell right and wrong.

00:22:18.059 --> 00:22:18.976
So,

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:21.740
you've been avoiding me

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:23.420
because who I am?

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.040
Old man.

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:33.088
Are you saying

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:34.900
if I weren't of Night Clan,

00:22:36.059 --> 00:22:37.299
I wouldn't be treated this way?

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:39.339
What do you want to say?

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:43.700
I, Bai Chuli, love and hate boldly.

00:22:44.779 --> 00:22:45.696
Now,

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.079
I have a crush on Wan Guchen.

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:50.980
If you fear me

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:52.980
because who I am.

00:22:53.859 --> 00:22:54.944
Today,

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:56.832
I'll extract my demonic bone

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:58.619
from my body.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:00.864
Are you insane?

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:07.380
Do you know the pain
of demonic bone extraction

00:23:07.579 --> 00:23:09.220
rivals having your heart devoured?

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:10.660
A mistake

00:23:11.259 --> 00:23:12.940
could lead you vanish into ashes.

00:23:14.019 --> 00:23:15.259
Even so,

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:16.420
do you still do so?

00:23:18.019 --> 00:23:18.912
Of course.

00:23:19.339 --> 00:23:20.460
I won't regret it.

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:23.339
Stop!

00:23:23.339 --> 00:23:24.352
Don't come closer!

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:32.224
Wan Guchen.

00:23:33.259 --> 00:23:34.208

I never imagined

00:23:38.019 --> 00:23:39.299
I'd fall for you again.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:43.980
This demonic bone means nothing

00:23:45.259 --> 00:23:46.500
compared to you.

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:19.872
Now,

00:24:21.779 --> 00:24:25.660
who dares to question me?

00:24:26.819 --> 00:24:29.140
I never expected you are so resolved.

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:31.779
I really admire you now.

00:24:32.539 --> 00:24:34.579
But I never agreed

00:24:35.059 --> 00:24:36.140
that I'd spare your life

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:38.099

00:28:58.019 --> 00:28:59.460
Sorry that I went to look for you

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:00.579
and caused your injuries.

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:03.019
Rest assured.

00:29:03.019 --> 00:29:04.220
I'll protect you.

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:17.312
What's wrong?

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.019
Back in the Nine Heavens,

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:26.859
there was a voice

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:29.500
constantly speaking in my mind.

00:29:33.299 --> 00:29:35.099
You know what it is,

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:36.800
don't you?

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:43.819
The Deity of Night Clan.

00:29:47.259 --> 00:29:48.256
Night Deity?

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:51.456
Impossible.

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:55.500
That's an ancient evil god from myths.

00:29:56.339 --> 00:29:57.619
He shouldn't exist!

00:29:58.420 --> 00:29:59.339
He did exist.

00:30:01.299 --> 00:30:02.900
He did exist three centuries ago.

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:04.740
I slew him.

00:30:08.779 --> 00:30:10.539
Now he's revived within you.

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:14.259
Once the Night Deity's seal
within you weakens,

00:30:15.819 --> 00:30:17.099
he'll fully awaken.

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:21.980
When that happens,

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:24.460
I'll vanish completely?
