00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.184
Hi, Seol-ha.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.646
It's super awkward saying hi to you
in a text message.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.858
Whimpering. Honestly--

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:47.979
Gosh...

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.360
SENDING MESSAGE TO KWON SEOL-HA

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:52.196
MESSAGE SENT

00:01:54.498 --> 00:01:56.909
Where... Where did I stop? Oh, right.

00:01:58.101 --> 00:02:01.830
I think I hesitated a thousand times
about whether or not I should tell you.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.749
I've never once--

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:05.543
Shoot.

00:02:08.612 --> 00:02:09.796
Sent.

00:02:10.572 --> 00:02:13.800
...confessed my true feelings
to anyone before.

00:02:15.302 --> 00:02:17.012
But I guess when you really--

00:02:18.121 --> 00:02:20.723
This darn 40-character limit.

00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:27.939
There. And then...

00:02:30.092 --> 00:02:32.361
When you really like someone,

00:02:33.445 --> 00:02:36.198
it gives you this unexpected courage.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.469
Gosh! I just blurted out

00:02:39.553 --> 00:02:42.788
that I liked you without even meaning to.

00:02:44.648 --> 00:02:47.584
Well, I won't hide it anymore.

00:02:48.377 --> 00:02:51.005
Seol-ha, the truth is...

00:02:51.697 --> 00:02:52.840
I like you.

00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:58.345
It feels so gratifying to finally say
what's been on my mind.

00:02:59.221 --> 00:03:01.221
And now, I'm curious about how you feel.

00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:03.725
Seol-ha,

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.562
how do you feel about me?

00:03:17.406 --> 00:03:20.367
Done. It's game over.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.202
CRINGY ROMANCE

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:23.662
I did it.

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:36.633
I'll wait for your reply.

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:49.812
You don't have to answer me now
if it's too much pressure.

00:04:02.184 --> 00:04:05.245
Will you at least tell me
if you read my text or not?

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:09.541
Text me the number one
if you've read it.

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:44.365
It's just that it's frustrating.

00:04:44.714 --> 00:04:46.290
I can't even sleep--

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:48.580
What the heck?

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:56.921
NEW MESSAGE FROM KWON SEOL-HA

00:04:57.004 --> 00:05:00.109
NEW MESSAGE FROM KWON SEOL-HA

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:24.700
I couldn't reply right away
because I didn't know what to say. Sorry.

00:05:25.951 --> 00:05:28.662
To be honest, I've never really thought
about us that way.

00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:31.206
You're such a good friend.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.667
Can we stay as good friends?

00:05:34.543 --> 00:05:37.004
I'll pretend I never saw your messages.

00:05:37.838 --> 00:05:39.631
Have a good weekend, then.

00:05:41.358 --> 00:05:42.593
Min-gi.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.348
Even I don't think it's going to work out.

00:05:56.173 --> 00:05:57.524
Guys.

00:05:58.467 --> 00:06:01.778
How are you ever going to have
a girlfriend?

00:06:02.537 --> 00:06:04.806
You just don't get women.

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:06.908
You don't get them at all.

00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:11.121
Look.

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:16.084
Why do you think she used the phrase,

00:06:16.918 --> 00:06:18.169
"good friend?"

00:06:18.987 --> 00:06:20.655
She could have said
you were just a friend.

00:06:20.738 --> 00:06:24.759
But she added the adjective "good"
in front of "friend."

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:27.051
And she did it twice. Why?

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:31.500
A good friend is a friend

00:06:31.583 --> 00:06:33.101
whom she likes.

00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:34.492
Not a regular friend,

00:06:34.648 --> 00:06:37.220
but a friend
with a chance of becoming more.

00:06:38.273 --> 00:06:39.858
Is that what that is?

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:42.277
You need to read between the lines.

00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:51.244
Wait. What about the part where she wrote,
"I'll pretend I never saw your messages?"

00:06:51.679 --> 00:06:55.373
It simply means you confessed
your feelings the wrong way.

00:06:55.464 --> 00:06:57.817
- What do you mean?
- A text message

00:06:58.026 --> 00:07:02.240
can't convey the atmosphere,
your look, tone,

00:07:02.356 --> 00:07:04.966
- or nuance.
- Right.

00:07:05.049 --> 00:07:07.302
Asking her out through a text message is
so lame.

00:07:07.711 --> 00:07:09.255
What a disappointment.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.890
So, what should I do?

00:07:12.457 --> 00:07:15.310
Min-gi, take a step back for now.

00:07:15.544 --> 00:07:18.230
- Why?
- Seol-ha wants to stay as friends.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.857
Then, you need to keep pace with her.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.485
You think he'll be able to do that?

00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:26.513
At first,

00:07:26.596 --> 00:07:29.283
she'll treat you normally
as she usually did.

00:07:29.658 --> 00:07:31.658
But it's going to be so awkward. Why?

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:33.868
Because she already knows
you're into her.

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:37.666
What happens when things are awkward?
She'll avoid being alone with you.

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:41.169
And after some time,
she'll start avoiding you altogether.

00:07:41.496 --> 00:07:43.496
Then, you'll think,
"Why are you avoiding me?"

00:07:43.586 --> 00:07:45.586
"Am I a bug to you?"
Do you find me unpleasant?"

00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:47.634
"Was it so wrong
to confess my feelings to you?"

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:49.717
"Is it a crime to love someone?"
You'll think it's unfair.

00:07:49.953 --> 00:07:51.638
You'll be angry, upset, and pissed!

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:52.777
But you know something?

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.517
All that is going to pop out
when you least expect it.

00:07:57.185 --> 00:07:58.436
All right?

00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:05.652
That was so graphic.

00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:07.779
Then, what?

00:08:08.346 --> 00:08:10.346
What do you mean? Then, it's over.

00:08:10.429 --> 00:08:11.616
The end.

00:08:12.642 --> 00:08:13.826
Gwang-jae.

00:08:14.044 --> 00:08:15.537
How do you know women so well?

00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:17.914
Not to brag,

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:21.251
but in high school, a dozen girls
stopped coming to the academy

00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:22.569
after I confessed my feelings.

00:08:22.652 --> 00:08:24.652
Gosh. What a serial love confessor.

00:08:24.888 --> 00:08:27.424
So, what am I supposed to do?

00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:29.801
You need to do it in person.

00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:32.262
Tell her your feelings in her face.

00:08:32.746 --> 00:08:35.891
Face her, and tell her how you feel
in your own voice right now.

00:08:36.082 --> 00:08:39.102
Right now? It's a little late.
How about tomorrow?

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:40.853
Min-gi, you should never do it tomorrow.

00:08:41.087 --> 00:08:43.281
Then, you can't even be friends
with her anymore.

00:08:43.364 --> 00:08:46.109
Friends? He already showed his hand.

00:08:46.384 --> 00:08:48.653
You have to keep pushing, no matter what.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.425
- Yes.
- Do it tomorrow.

00:08:50.509 --> 00:08:52.082
- Tomorrow.
- It'll be too late the day after that.

00:08:52.323 --> 00:08:53.741
The day after that is too late.

00:08:59.898 --> 00:09:02.834
Min-gi, why are you breathing like that?

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:05.877
Don't tell me
you're going to tell her tomorrow.

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:11.259
Do it tomorrow.
It'll be too late the day after tomorrow.

00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:36.701
It dates back to ancient times.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.204
The Prehistoric Age,
the Unified Silla period,

00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:41.748
and the Goryeo Dynasty.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.584
But Seol-ha never showed up to school.

00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:47.128
The day after,

00:09:47.362 --> 00:09:48.880
and the day after that.

00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:52.759
Could it be because of me?

00:10:20.128 --> 00:10:22.789
Can I borrow your notes
from English Literature?

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:26.751
Oh, wait. You didn't even come to class.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.481
You're coming to school tomorrow, right?

00:10:51.092 --> 00:10:52.193
SENDING MESSAGE TO KWON SEOL-HA

00:11:10.153 --> 00:11:11.629
She never replied.

00:11:58.176 --> 00:11:59.594
The convenience store guy?

00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:02.180
Hi.

00:12:04.515 --> 00:12:06.142
You even do paper rounds?

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:09.103
Yes.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:17.821
You must have drunk a lot.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.376
Here. You should wear this and go home.

00:13:55.193 --> 00:13:56.795
It's waterproof.

00:13:59.739 --> 00:14:01.674
- Why?
- Sorry?

00:14:02.717 --> 00:14:03.843
Well,

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:05.678
it's raining.

00:14:08.122 --> 00:14:09.473
What about you?

00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:14.770
I'm already pretty wet,

00:14:14.853 --> 00:14:17.023
and I'm sweaty right now.

00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:20.235
But the jacket isn't sweaty.

00:14:38.611 --> 00:14:39.921
Hey.

00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:45.552
Can you cook ramyeon?

00:16:11.954 --> 00:16:13.097
It smells so good.

00:16:32.366 --> 00:16:33.617
Does it taste better if you do that?

00:16:34.519 --> 00:16:35.703
What?

00:16:36.921 --> 00:16:39.415
This way, the noodles turn out firmer.

00:16:40.825 --> 00:16:42.168
I see.

00:16:56.005 --> 00:16:57.005
Here.

00:16:57.959 --> 00:16:58.959
Cheers.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.325
You've got to down the first shot.

00:17:22.333 --> 00:17:24.333
It looks delicious.

00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:28.130
It's so good.

00:17:28.464 --> 00:17:30.257
You cook amazing ramyeon.

00:17:30.975 --> 00:17:32.975
- Thanks.
- What's your name?

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:35.870
Oh, I'm...

00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:39.600
- Kwon Gi-hyeok.
- Kwon Gi-hyeok?

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:41.143
I'm Choi Hui-seon.

00:17:41.605 --> 00:17:43.312
- You--
- How old are you?

00:17:43.771 --> 00:17:45.564
I'm 20 years old.

00:17:46.607 --> 00:17:48.109
We're the same age.

00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:50.695
I see.

00:17:51.012 --> 00:17:54.490
That calls, for another shot.

00:18:07.987 --> 00:18:09.171
Nice to meet you, Gi-hyeok.

00:18:10.298 --> 00:18:11.758
We're the same age,
so you can drop the honorifics.

00:18:14.385 --> 00:18:15.928
Yes.

00:18:16.304 --> 00:18:17.514
I mean, sure.

00:18:18.748 --> 00:18:21.684
Why are you kneeling, by the way?

00:18:22.151 --> 00:18:25.312
It felt more comfortable this way.
But I can sit.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:27.649
- Sit comfortably.
- Okay.

00:18:34.831 --> 00:18:36.333
You're not much of a drinker, are you?

00:18:37.433 --> 00:18:38.492
What?

00:18:39.702 --> 00:18:42.330
I knew I still had it.

00:18:43.656 --> 00:18:45.916
I envy you, though.

00:18:46.417 --> 00:18:47.877
You can get drunk easily.

00:18:50.363 --> 00:18:51.673
I want some soup.

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:55.343
It's so delicious.

00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:58.596
Thanks. Have some soup.

00:19:18.724 --> 00:19:20.367
Your face is so red!

00:19:20.918 --> 00:19:22.911
You really can't handle alcohol, can you?

00:19:29.594 --> 00:19:30.753
That's cute.

00:19:44.125 --> 00:19:45.601
Why am I so red?

00:20:33.854 --> 00:20:34.858
How could this happen?

00:20:35.254 --> 00:20:38.953
So, you're saying
that one of us was spitting on ants

00:20:39.037 --> 00:20:41.199
when a girl walked up to him
and started a conversation

00:20:41.361 --> 00:20:44.744
and the other one was doing a paper round
when a girl asked him to cook ramyeon

00:20:45.102 --> 00:20:46.370
in her house?

00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:53.544
No. It can't be.

00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:55.170
This can't be happening.

00:20:55.253 --> 00:20:58.382
That's not how things are supposed to work
in this world.

00:21:00.226 --> 00:21:03.204
Jun-seok. Am I wrong?

00:21:03.288 --> 00:21:05.014
This shouldn't be happening.

00:21:05.481 --> 00:21:07.600
- Please tell me it isn't.
- So, what happened next?

00:21:08.125 --> 00:21:09.977
She fell asleep, so I just left.

00:21:11.712 --> 00:21:12.813
What?

00:21:13.255 --> 00:21:15.774
She just fell asleep
when a stranger was in her house?

00:21:16.092 --> 00:21:17.124
What does that mean?

00:21:18.027 --> 00:21:19.612
- That sounds fishy.
- Right.

00:21:19.987 --> 00:21:21.155
Something's off with her.

00:21:21.472 --> 00:21:23.557
No, she's not exactly weird.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:25.712
- How do you know?
- I can tell

00:21:25.796 --> 00:21:27.953
from the way she speaks.

00:21:28.187 --> 00:21:29.622
You're interested in her, aren't you?

00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:31.958
No, I'm not.

00:21:32.301 --> 00:21:35.438
I can't afford to be interested in a girl,
considering my circumstances.

00:21:35.522 --> 00:21:36.794
What's wrong with your circumstances?

00:21:36.878 --> 00:21:39.663
I'm too busy working to make money
and pay off my loan.

00:21:40.007 --> 00:21:43.135
He always spoils things
when things get interesting.

00:21:46.347 --> 00:21:47.765
My miserable buddy.

00:21:48.182 --> 00:21:50.726
That darn love, right?

00:21:51.268 --> 00:21:52.913
Seol-ha can be pretty mean, though.

00:21:52.996 --> 00:21:54.813
She didn't come to school
just because you confessed?

00:21:55.005 --> 00:21:57.074
Come on. It can't be because of Min-gi.

00:21:57.174 --> 00:21:59.151
Maybe she's injured.

00:22:23.951 --> 00:22:26.178
I knew it was an evil thought,

00:22:26.929 --> 00:22:30.891
but I even hoped she couldn't show up
because she was injured.

00:22:32.752 --> 00:22:34.752
I hoped that it wasn't because of me.

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.277
CLASS A-103

00:22:41.969 --> 00:22:43.654
I think you're right.

00:23:10.014 --> 00:23:12.391
Do you know her boyfriend
in Korean Literature?

00:23:13.017 --> 00:23:14.519
I know!

00:23:15.085 --> 00:23:17.354
How can she be so nonchalant?

00:23:18.647 --> 00:23:20.149
If I had known him...

00:23:20.232 --> 00:23:22.442
I've been miserable for four days.

00:23:43.197 --> 00:23:44.507
I should stop.

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:46.967
I should stop being emotional
and start being rational.

00:23:47.676 --> 00:23:51.013
I like her more, so this is inevitable.

00:23:56.052 --> 00:23:57.687
You've grown,

00:23:58.145 --> 00:23:59.605
Min-gi.

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:21.501
Hey, it's been so long.

00:24:22.378 --> 00:24:23.462
It has.

00:24:24.254 --> 00:24:25.505
How have you been?

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:29.927
What have you been up to lately?

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:31.470
You weren't around for a while.

00:24:31.929 --> 00:24:33.472
No, not much.

00:24:35.683 --> 00:24:37.935
That's a cool shirt. Which brand is it?

00:24:38.477 --> 00:24:40.062
My mom bought it for me.

00:24:41.689 --> 00:24:42.940
It suits you.

00:24:49.013 --> 00:24:50.114
You know,

00:24:50.631 --> 00:24:52.366
- the text I sent you--
- Oh, right.

00:24:53.283 --> 00:24:54.868
We're supposed to get a copy
of the materials for Classical Literature.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.287
Yes, but it's until our next class.

00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:58.830
Is that right?

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:00.958
That's a relief.

00:25:02.501 --> 00:25:03.877
You know,

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.088
- the text--
- You know what?

00:25:05.171 --> 00:25:07.756
- I'll just get it now.
- Is this because of the text?

00:25:09.258 --> 00:25:11.927
Because of the text messages I sent you?

00:25:14.747 --> 00:25:17.099
We agreed to act like that never happened.

00:25:19.018 --> 00:25:20.478
Yes.

00:25:21.295 --> 00:25:22.438
We did.

00:25:23.397 --> 00:25:26.358
But why didn't you reply to the text
I sent you the day before yesterday?

00:25:29.069 --> 00:25:30.779
Why are you doing this?

00:25:32.573 --> 00:25:34.575
I've got my own situation too.

00:25:36.243 --> 00:25:38.412
You're only making things awkward
by doing this.

00:25:44.877 --> 00:25:45.878
Sorry.

00:25:51.967 --> 00:25:54.261
Why haven't you come to school
in the past few days?

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:55.846
Is it because of me?

00:25:56.972 --> 00:25:59.349
Let's stop. I'm going.

00:26:00.334 --> 00:26:02.903
Wait. Seol-ha!

00:26:03.028 --> 00:26:05.272
Wait. Look.

00:26:05.606 --> 00:26:06.816
Take a look at this.

00:26:07.107 --> 00:26:08.984
Look.

00:26:09.551 --> 00:26:11.303
You said you wanted to go.

00:26:11.428 --> 00:26:13.405
I bought the tickets to the rock festival.

00:26:13.664 --> 00:26:16.366
You'll go to this with me, right?

00:26:19.311 --> 00:26:20.454
Hey!

00:26:20.729 --> 00:26:21.913
Seol-ha!

00:26:23.107 --> 00:26:26.127
You said that you wanted to go!

00:26:28.337 --> 00:26:29.380
Hey!

00:26:29.989 --> 00:26:31.340
These were expensive!

00:26:32.424 --> 00:26:34.424
Seol-ha. Hey!

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.399
There's barely anything left
after covering the overdue rent.

00:26:53.946 --> 00:26:56.615
Have you heard
about another rental store opening...

00:26:56.949 --> 00:26:58.033
across the street?

00:26:58.784 --> 00:27:00.953
Why do you keep stressing over it?

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:02.871
Stop worrying.

00:27:09.586 --> 00:27:11.908
Mr. Won. I'm truly sorry.

00:27:11.992 --> 00:27:14.783
- I'll make sure to pay the rent then.
- Come on.

00:27:14.866 --> 00:27:16.176
Just take it.

00:27:17.511 --> 00:27:18.804
Thank you.

00:27:19.121 --> 00:27:20.472
Study hard.

00:27:26.571 --> 00:27:28.571
2000 MILLENNIAL ROCK FESTIVAL,
REGULAR SEAT, 80 DOLLARS

00:28:35.864 --> 00:28:37.090
Min-gi.

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:39.468
What?

00:28:39.993 --> 00:28:41.386
Do you have time?

00:28:41.845 --> 00:28:43.289
I need to talk to you.

00:28:43.373 --> 00:28:45.373
I'm busy right now.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:50.104
Well, I--

00:29:04.756 --> 00:29:05.749
Hey.

00:29:06.562 --> 00:29:09.456
Shouldn't we tell Min-gi about Seol-ha?

00:29:09.773 --> 00:29:13.293
What's the point?
It looks like he's over her.

00:29:13.986 --> 00:29:16.505
I think he'll be heartbroken
when he finds out later.

00:29:16.613 --> 00:29:18.798
Don't stir him up. Just let him be.

00:29:18.881 --> 00:29:20.675
It'll be our problem
when he has an outburst.

00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:29.225
Hey. Look. She's so hot.

00:29:29.518 --> 00:29:31.895
Over there. She's coming inside.

00:29:31.978 --> 00:29:33.397
Look.

00:29:36.425 --> 00:29:38.152
Did you see her?

00:29:39.011 --> 00:29:40.279
Man.

00:29:40.596 --> 00:29:43.872
What lucky guy could be dating her?

00:29:44.116 --> 00:29:44.949
Guys.

00:29:45.033 --> 00:29:47.244
I'm playing Zerg tonight.
You can play other races.

00:29:47.436 --> 00:29:49.104
That's not important.

00:29:49.229 --> 00:29:52.040
There's a hot girl over there.
Take a look.

00:29:55.135 --> 00:29:56.461
Did you see her?

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:58.297
She's so hot, right?

00:30:01.934 --> 00:30:03.218
Are you done with your shift?

00:30:05.454 --> 00:30:06.705
I'm sorry?

00:30:06.972 --> 00:30:08.390
Do you want to go for a drink?

00:30:09.958 --> 00:30:11.268
What?

00:30:15.105 --> 00:30:16.798
Hi, we're Gi-hyeok's friends.

00:30:16.881 --> 00:30:18.650
Oh, hi.

00:30:18.984 --> 00:30:21.570
Gi-hyeok, we got what we came here for.
We'll see you next time.

00:30:22.112 --> 00:30:23.530
Is this for real?

00:30:24.114 --> 00:30:25.282
Bye.

00:30:26.792 --> 00:30:28.744
Hold on. I forgot my backpack.

00:30:28.827 --> 00:30:29.870
Come here.

00:30:46.036 --> 00:30:48.722
So, you do paper rounds in the morning

00:30:48.805 --> 00:30:50.805
and work at the convenience store
in the evening?

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:55.270
- Yes.
- You're so hardworking.

00:30:57.775 --> 00:30:58.815
CEO PARK

00:31:10.752 --> 00:31:12.245
Should I work at a convenience store?

00:31:12.854 --> 00:31:14.289
Do you want to?

00:31:14.873 --> 00:31:17.776
Actually, the evening part-timer said
he was quitting soon.

00:31:17.859 --> 00:31:20.795
- How much do they pay?
- It's 1.60 dollars an hour.

00:31:22.864 --> 00:31:25.050
Oh, I see.

00:31:25.133 --> 00:31:26.927
No job is easy, I guess.

00:31:28.036 --> 00:31:29.679
Do you want me to ask the owner?

00:31:29.762 --> 00:31:31.640
No, that's fine.

00:31:35.127 --> 00:31:37.354
You must not know this, but...

00:31:38.939 --> 00:31:40.190
What?

00:31:40.532 --> 00:31:41.775
What do you mean?

00:31:42.192 --> 00:31:43.985
What I'm about to tell you can be
incredibly tempting.

00:31:44.861 --> 00:31:45.987
What is it?

00:31:46.722 --> 00:31:48.365
When you work the evening shift,

00:31:49.783 --> 00:31:51.743
you can get expired food for free.

00:31:55.455 --> 00:31:56.539
And?

00:31:59.876 --> 00:32:01.669
And you can eat it.

00:32:31.491 --> 00:32:34.411
By the way, what's your major?

00:32:34.895 --> 00:32:36.455
I don't go to school.

00:32:37.939 --> 00:32:38.957
Oh...

00:32:39.583 --> 00:32:40.584
I see.

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:43.128
Don't you have any plans tonight?

00:32:44.546 --> 00:32:46.047
Work got canceled at the last minute.

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:48.383
Work? What kind of work?

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:51.552
Oh, I work part-time at a bar.

00:32:52.095 --> 00:32:54.597
Oh, where?

00:32:54.806 --> 00:32:55.807
Like a pub?

00:32:56.266 --> 00:32:58.266
- A soju bar?
- It's a bar.

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:00.603
- A bar?
- Yes.

00:33:01.813 --> 00:33:03.148
So,

00:33:03.548 --> 00:33:04.816
are you a bartender?

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:08.987
Sort of.

00:33:09.321 --> 00:33:11.782
I see.

00:33:12.182 --> 00:33:13.408
That's cool.

00:33:14.576 --> 00:33:17.496
Do you also make cocktails?

00:33:18.371 --> 00:33:20.498
- Just the easy ones.
- I see.

00:33:21.291 --> 00:33:23.001
Okay.

00:33:23.335 --> 00:33:24.586
Cool.

00:33:27.781 --> 00:33:28.924
Where is it?

00:33:29.449 --> 00:33:30.884
Can I come over?

00:33:32.177 --> 00:33:34.679
Sure. You can visit when I'm working.
I'll give you a shot.

00:33:37.649 --> 00:33:38.917
CEO PARK

00:33:47.259 --> 00:33:49.444
That's okay. You can take it.

00:33:49.945 --> 00:33:51.945
No, it's a customer.

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:54.782
- A customer?
- Yes, from the bar where I work.

00:33:55.367 --> 00:33:57.035
Shouldn't you take it, then?

00:33:57.661 --> 00:33:59.830
I said it was fine.

00:34:00.622 --> 00:34:02.165
Let's drink.

00:34:02.566 --> 00:34:04.126
Cheers.

00:34:26.147 --> 00:34:28.992
I just saw Seol-ha
in the department office.

00:34:29.141 --> 00:34:30.576
I think she's dropping out.

00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:32.660
Yes, I heard she was leaving
to study in the US.

00:34:32.804 --> 00:34:34.405
What? Where?

00:34:34.488 --> 00:34:36.491
I heard it was an art school in LA

00:34:36.574 --> 00:34:38.310
- or something.
- What?

00:34:38.394 --> 00:34:40.394
How can a Korean major go
to an art school?

00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:42.955
- How would I know?
- Are you being serious?

00:34:43.248 --> 00:34:45.083
I was so close.

00:34:45.233 --> 00:34:47.233
I swear I almost won her over.

00:34:54.334 --> 00:34:55.426
MAKE SURE TO CHECK YOUR GRADES

00:34:55.952 --> 00:34:58.888
Ma'am,
is Kwon Seol-ha going abroad to study?

00:34:58.971 --> 00:35:00.056
Seol-ha?

00:35:00.139 --> 00:35:02.267
It looks like the school in the US sent

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:03.727
the acceptance sooner than she thought.

00:35:04.185 --> 00:35:07.480
She just went
through the withdrawal process and left.

00:35:08.507 --> 00:35:09.858
Damn it.

00:36:01.117 --> 00:36:03.786
Hey, kid, you forgot your fare!

00:36:11.046 --> 00:36:13.197
Can you give me a second?

00:36:18.176 --> 00:36:21.679
I forgot my wallet.
Can you lend me a dollar?

00:36:21.888 --> 00:36:23.056
Oh, okay.

00:36:39.072 --> 00:36:40.365
Here.

00:36:54.904 --> 00:36:56.422
I heard you were going abroad.

00:36:57.907 --> 00:36:59.091
I am.

00:37:01.094 --> 00:37:02.679
Why didn't you tell me?

00:37:04.481 --> 00:37:06.481
I was going to,

00:37:06.564 --> 00:37:08.351
but you never gave me a chance.

00:37:18.987 --> 00:37:20.655
Can I ask you a question?

00:37:22.449 --> 00:37:23.617
What is it?

00:37:25.827 --> 00:37:27.620
Did you like me or not?

00:37:33.209 --> 00:37:34.891
You don't want to answer me?

00:37:34.975 --> 00:37:37.155
- I liked you as a friend.
- No, as a man.

00:37:37.238 --> 00:37:38.590
I never thought about you that way.

00:37:40.133 --> 00:37:42.260
Then, think about it now. I'll wait.

00:37:43.086 --> 00:37:44.304
No.

00:37:46.723 --> 00:37:48.934
Am I that unattractive to you?

00:37:52.712 --> 00:37:53.813
I know

00:37:54.606 --> 00:37:56.606
I'm not some impressive guy or anything.

00:37:56.841 --> 00:37:57.859
I know that.

00:37:58.443 --> 00:38:00.443
That's not what I mean.

00:38:00.579 --> 00:38:02.039
Why can't you understand me?

00:38:02.122 --> 00:38:04.241
Why can't you understand my feelings?

00:38:04.741 --> 00:38:07.243
You knew how I felt about you.

00:38:08.436 --> 00:38:10.079
Do you only care about your feelings?

00:38:12.707 --> 00:38:15.376
What do you expect me to do
when I just don't feel that way?

00:38:26.788 --> 00:38:29.307
- Bitch.
- What?

00:38:32.752 --> 00:38:34.312
Whatever. Bye.

00:38:41.761 --> 00:38:44.197
Sir?

00:38:44.572 --> 00:38:45.865
Sir, I--

00:38:47.867 --> 00:38:49.160
Crap.

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:51.287
Sir!

00:39:16.087 --> 00:39:18.356
And just like that,
the season of my first love

00:39:19.107 --> 00:39:20.775
came to an end.

00:39:39.486 --> 00:39:40.879
Min-gi, come out and eat!

00:39:51.664 --> 00:39:53.140
Aren't you going to eat?

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:54.935
I'll see you tonight.

00:39:56.352 --> 00:39:59.272
- Min-gi, your dad is leaving for work.
- Leave him.

00:40:11.184 --> 00:40:12.619
- I'm home.
- Hi.

00:40:37.544 --> 00:40:41.689
An American scientist once said this.

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:47.362
"As time goes by,"
"the human brain tends to erase"

00:40:47.512 --> 00:40:49.512
"painful and difficult memories,"

00:40:49.722 --> 00:40:51.741
"leaving behind only the faint traces"

00:40:51.825 --> 00:40:54.494
"of what feels
like warm, nostalgic moments."

00:40:58.731 --> 00:41:00.875
Well, he's wrong.

00:41:18.176 --> 00:41:19.519
Hey. Spit in this.

00:41:21.254 --> 00:41:24.587
Are you all right?
I told you not to smoke.

00:41:24.671 --> 00:41:26.067
You told me to.

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:28.695
I got him. You can go.

00:41:29.345 --> 00:41:31.489
You're leaving? What...

00:41:31.572 --> 00:41:33.324
But Gi-hyeok...

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:34.784
Fine.

00:41:36.828 --> 00:41:38.121
Go.

00:41:39.956 --> 00:41:41.541
- Gwang-jae.
- Yes.

00:41:43.626 --> 00:41:45.503
Why are cigarettes so nasty?

00:41:46.129 --> 00:41:48.265
She had no problem smoking these.

00:41:48.448 --> 00:41:49.883
So, why not me?

00:41:50.462 --> 00:41:51.550
Am I

00:41:52.093 --> 00:41:54.387
nastier than this to you?

00:41:55.939 --> 00:41:57.265
Are you sure you two can handle him?

00:41:58.224 --> 00:42:00.393
"Handle?" Just get out of here.

00:42:00.502 --> 00:42:03.020
We'll take care of him. Have fun.

00:42:03.404 --> 00:42:05.356
Is he going out to have fun?

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:07.317
No, I'm not.

00:42:07.634 --> 00:42:10.737
I'm just going to her workplace
to help her with things.

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:14.991
Promise me you'll only fix her computer
and come back.

00:42:15.908 --> 00:42:17.076
What else would I do?

00:42:17.159 --> 00:42:20.329
Don't go to her place
for ramyeon or anything.

00:42:24.959 --> 00:42:26.252
I'm leaving.

00:42:27.128 --> 00:42:28.504
Man, I'm so jealous.

00:42:28.655 --> 00:42:30.090
Hey.

00:42:30.531 --> 00:42:33.092
Look at me. Why won't you look at me?

00:42:33.493 --> 00:42:34.594
Will you look at--

00:42:34.853 --> 00:42:35.980
You are looking at me.

00:42:37.388 --> 00:42:39.248
Where has he gone?

00:42:48.466 --> 00:42:50.193
Oh, it's playing.

00:42:50.276 --> 00:42:52.276
No way!

00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:57.992
The problem was
the worn-out speaker cables.

00:42:58.075 --> 00:43:00.661
- I see.
- You know your way with computers too?

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:05.792
Also, I had a power supply lying around,

00:43:05.875 --> 00:43:07.502
so I changed that too.

00:43:07.777 --> 00:43:10.004
I didn't know you had a friend like him,
Hui-seon.

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.880
- He's cool, isn't he?
- He is.

00:43:14.383 --> 00:43:16.802
Take a seat over there.
Do you want a drink?

00:43:17.094 --> 00:43:18.163
Sorry?

00:43:18.246 --> 00:43:20.390
Oh, that's okay.

00:43:20.581 --> 00:43:22.308
I have to go to my part-time job soon.

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:23.935
I'm fine.

00:43:24.043 --> 00:43:26.043
You should at least stay for dinner.

00:43:27.422 --> 00:43:29.065
I can make you kkakdugi kimchi fried rice.

00:43:29.732 --> 00:43:31.609
It's about time we had dinner, anyway.

00:43:32.443 --> 00:43:34.820
Her kkakdugi kimchi fried rice is
incredibly good.

00:43:35.221 --> 00:43:36.405
You should stay.

00:43:39.534 --> 00:43:40.827
Okay.

00:43:41.602 --> 00:43:42.912
Wait here.

00:43:52.155 --> 00:43:55.526
- What do you think?
- Honestly, this is so good.

00:43:55.633 --> 00:43:57.343
- Right?
- Yes.

00:43:57.660 --> 00:43:59.637
How did you make this?

00:44:00.054 --> 00:44:02.306
Come on. That's a secret.

00:44:02.582 --> 00:44:05.518
- She puts a bunch of MSG--
- Hey!

00:44:06.502 --> 00:44:08.270
Seriously.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:12.372
Anyway, when I'm gone,
I'll be running

00:44:12.455 --> 00:44:14.610
a kkakdugi fried rice place there,
so find me there.

00:44:15.802 --> 00:44:16.904
Where is that?

00:44:17.555 --> 00:44:18.698
America?

00:44:19.365 --> 00:44:20.741
It's San Francisco.

00:44:21.159 --> 00:44:22.535
It's not America?

00:44:24.912 --> 00:44:26.247
Why there, of all places?

00:44:26.831 --> 00:44:29.208
Me? America just sounds cool.

00:44:29.876 --> 00:44:31.336
You can't even speak English.

00:44:31.419 --> 00:44:33.419
My survival English is no joke.

00:44:33.546 --> 00:44:35.048
- Is it no joke?
- Yes!

00:44:35.131 --> 00:44:36.215
Is that right?

00:44:36.689 --> 00:44:38.176
You're so annoying.

00:44:41.537 --> 00:44:44.139
But there aren't any customers yet.

00:44:45.016 --> 00:44:47.560
It's only 7 p.m. We open at 8 p.m.

00:44:48.019 --> 00:44:49.103
I see.

00:44:49.629 --> 00:44:51.626
- You open really late.
- Yes.

00:44:59.013 --> 00:45:00.948
- I'll get you a glass of water.
- Thanks.

00:45:05.978 --> 00:45:07.978
This is really good.

00:45:08.061 --> 00:45:09.206
Have some more.

00:45:14.237 --> 00:45:15.547
Hui-seon is pretty, isn't she?

00:45:16.614 --> 00:45:17.632
Sorry?

00:45:18.871 --> 00:45:20.122
Well...

00:45:21.647 --> 00:45:23.805
Yes. She's pretty.

00:45:24.972 --> 00:45:26.599
She's a good girl.

00:45:26.974 --> 00:45:28.142
You should give it a shot.

00:45:28.635 --> 00:45:29.936
What?

00:45:30.336 --> 00:45:31.604
Right.

00:45:32.204 --> 00:45:34.204
I've been in this line of work long enough

00:45:34.465 --> 00:45:36.465
to meet all kinds of girls,

00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:40.404
and it's rare to find someone
as kind and genuine as her.

00:45:42.949 --> 00:45:44.949
She may seem cheery on the outside,

00:45:45.376 --> 00:45:46.619
but she's a poor girl.

00:45:48.563 --> 00:45:50.832
- Be nice to her.
- Okay.

00:45:56.404 --> 00:45:57.880
What were you guys talking about?

00:45:58.172 --> 00:45:59.423
Were you talking about me?

00:46:00.216 --> 00:46:02.051
I was telling him to watch out for you

00:46:02.285 --> 00:46:04.804
- because you were the meanest girl.
- Gosh.

00:46:05.137 --> 00:46:06.472
- Here's your water.
- Thanks.

00:46:07.348 --> 00:46:09.684
I'll get going, then. Goodbye, ma'am.

00:46:15.523 --> 00:46:18.401
- They have amazing girls here.
- Is that right?

00:46:18.484 --> 00:46:21.070
- Move. It's cramped.
- Oh, boy.

00:46:22.013 --> 00:46:24.490
- It's this bar.
- Good.

00:46:26.726 --> 00:46:28.853
- Hello!
- Hi!

00:46:28.937 --> 00:46:30.204
I'm here.

00:46:31.747 --> 00:46:32.998
Go on in.

00:46:40.483 --> 00:46:42.800
HIDEOUT BAR

00:47:16.525 --> 00:47:18.085
Time passed.

00:47:18.653 --> 00:47:22.256
Can anyone tell me what it means
"to have anything worked out?"

00:47:22.923 --> 00:47:26.468
Does anyone know that?
What does it mean "to have worked it out?"

00:47:26.886 --> 00:47:28.827
- Usually, when I...
- Although the wounds

00:47:28.911 --> 00:47:30.471
Seol-ha left behind have healed...

00:47:35.616 --> 00:47:37.952
They left behind small scars.

00:47:41.217 --> 00:47:42.485
Are you feeling it?

00:47:44.028 --> 00:47:45.530
Look at him smoking.

00:47:45.846 --> 00:47:47.306
- He looks like such a nerd.
- I know.

00:47:48.738 --> 00:47:50.090
I tried to stop him.

00:47:50.493 --> 00:47:52.286
And at last...

00:47:54.355 --> 00:47:56.040
You all worked hard this semester.

00:47:56.415 --> 00:47:57.916
Have a great summer break!

00:47:58.042 --> 00:47:59.377
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:01.460
END OF THE SEMESTER

00:48:06.717 --> 00:48:08.886
I can't believe
the semester is already over.

00:48:09.136 --> 00:48:10.220
Finally.

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.168
- What are your plans during summer break?
- I want to try backpacking.

00:48:15.252 --> 00:48:17.194
- That sounds great. Let me come with you.
- Me too.

00:48:17.278 --> 00:48:18.855
We should go to Haeundae Beach.

00:48:18.938 --> 00:48:20.715
I heard all the hot girls go there
in the summer.

00:48:20.798 --> 00:48:22.573
Let's go and buy swimsuits, then!

00:48:22.657 --> 00:48:24.331
- It sounds so fun.
- I'm so excited!

00:48:24.985 --> 00:48:28.447
- Let's kill it this summer!
- Yes!

00:49:00.855 --> 00:49:03.483
- I'm going to my part-time job.
- Okay.

00:49:07.445 --> 00:49:09.364
I'll sleep at home tonight.

00:49:09.447 --> 00:49:10.740
Wait for me.

00:49:15.353 --> 00:49:16.704
Wait.

00:49:18.823 --> 00:49:19.832
Seol-ha!

00:49:20.499 --> 00:49:21.667
Seol-ha?

00:49:27.381 --> 00:49:28.652
Seol-ha, I'll be right back.

00:49:28.736 --> 00:49:30.259
- Watch the counter for me, okay?
- Okay.

00:49:30.618 --> 00:49:31.677
Thanks.

00:49:34.054 --> 00:49:35.389
I'd like to order.

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:38.559
- Sure.
- Two iced Americanos, please.

00:49:38.642 --> 00:49:39.643
Sure thing.

00:49:41.687 --> 00:49:43.480
- Here. Please wait.
- Thank you.

00:49:43.563 --> 00:49:47.134
YUN SEOL-HA

00:49:52.181 --> 00:49:53.365
YUN SEOL-HA

00:49:59.697 --> 00:50:03.918
Would you like to order?

00:50:08.514 --> 00:50:10.174
- Order?
- Pardon?

00:50:10.799 --> 00:50:11.925
Do you want to order?

00:50:16.330 --> 00:50:18.432
Oh, an iced black coffee.

00:50:18.599 --> 00:50:20.559
Iced coffee. That will be three dollars.

00:50:57.972 --> 00:50:59.849
Where to?

00:51:13.179 --> 00:51:15.907
It feels just like the old days
in Pyeongchang-dong, doesn't it?

00:51:17.199 --> 00:51:18.742
Can you stop bringing that up?

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:21.161
Jeez.

00:51:21.562 --> 00:51:24.415
My one and only son,
and he's so cold and blunt.

00:51:24.498 --> 00:51:26.418
You know how friendly your dad was?

00:51:26.502 --> 00:51:28.377
I don't know who you take after.

00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:30.460
Stop talking about Dad.

00:51:38.737 --> 00:51:40.389
Doesn't it hurt when you think about Dad?

00:51:41.081 --> 00:51:42.432
Sometimes.

00:51:43.475 --> 00:51:45.394
It hurts when I miss him
every once in a while,

00:51:46.921 --> 00:51:49.732
but it surprisingly doesn't hurt
when I miss him every day.

00:51:55.054 --> 00:51:56.155
What's this?

00:51:57.281 --> 00:51:58.449
For the ride.

00:52:04.204 --> 00:52:06.581
Stop giving me money.
Spend it on what you need.

00:52:07.124 --> 00:52:09.960
- Use it to buy a private taxi.
- Why would I buy a private taxi?

00:52:10.377 --> 00:52:12.045
So I can call for you when I go to work.

00:52:12.513 --> 00:52:14.197
It's easier to go to work this way.

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:15.674
- Jeez.
- It's like I have a car.

00:52:19.803 --> 00:52:20.804
CHOI HUI-SEON

00:52:24.350 --> 00:52:25.543
Hello?

00:52:26.477 --> 00:52:27.728
What?

00:52:29.037 --> 00:52:30.856
Yes, I'm on my way.

00:52:32.191 --> 00:52:33.275
What?

00:52:34.677 --> 00:52:35.945
No.

00:52:37.112 --> 00:52:38.322
I can speak.

00:52:39.907 --> 00:52:42.368
Yes, you can eat without me.

00:52:44.119 --> 00:52:45.370
Okay.

00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:47.831
Bye.

00:52:51.543 --> 00:52:53.003
Do you have a girlfriend?

00:52:55.008 --> 00:52:57.266
- It's not like that.
- What are you talking about?

00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:58.675
It was obviously a girl's voice.

00:53:00.227 --> 00:53:01.929
She's just a friend.

00:53:04.056 --> 00:53:05.766
A friend, huh?

00:53:09.687 --> 00:53:11.606
Having a friend is nice.

00:53:32.401 --> 00:53:34.420
Oh, look at you.

00:53:34.995 --> 00:53:37.339
- Coming to a part-time job in a taxi.
- Yes.

00:53:37.948 --> 00:53:40.175
Don't tell me that's your dinner.

00:53:40.759 --> 00:53:41.802
It is.

00:53:42.511 --> 00:53:43.554
Is that enough?

00:53:43.762 --> 00:53:47.432
I have to drink and eat food
when I go to work, so it's fine.

00:53:48.292 --> 00:53:49.810
You have to drink too?

00:53:49.985 --> 00:53:51.186
You said you were a bartender.

00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:54.648
The customers give me some shots
and ask to drink with them.

00:53:55.107 --> 00:53:58.235
Also, we can sell more drinks that way.

00:53:59.027 --> 00:54:00.320
I see.

00:54:01.447 --> 00:54:02.865
Anyway, you don't have to worry.

00:54:06.226 --> 00:54:08.662
Oh, I might be late. I'll go to work now.

00:54:08.745 --> 00:54:11.164
- Work hard today.
- Okay. Bye.

00:54:12.007 --> 00:54:13.291
But...

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.420
don't drink...

00:54:17.696 --> 00:54:18.755
too much.

00:54:22.676 --> 00:54:23.844
Why not?

00:54:24.453 --> 00:54:25.479
What?

00:54:26.805 --> 00:54:30.684
Well, if you drink too much,
it's bad for your health.

00:54:32.352 --> 00:54:34.104
Are you worried about me?

00:54:36.256 --> 00:54:39.401
You should hurry. You said you were late.

00:54:41.303 --> 00:54:43.447
Okay. I won't drink too much.

00:55:10.290 --> 00:55:11.516
I'm sure I'm mistaken.

00:55:11.975 --> 00:55:15.145
It's probably because she has the name.

00:55:18.966 --> 00:55:22.861
Would you like to order?

00:55:24.696 --> 00:55:26.239
You're an idiot.

00:55:26.348 --> 00:55:28.200
It's just your imagination.

00:55:51.949 --> 00:55:53.184
- Sir?
- Yes?

00:55:53.651 --> 00:55:55.651
- Can I help you?
- Right.

00:55:59.606 --> 00:56:00.941
It's a real flower.

00:56:01.158 --> 00:56:02.484
- Pardon?
- It's real...

00:56:02.826 --> 00:56:04.319
These aren't artificial flowers, right?

00:56:05.153 --> 00:56:06.529
No, they're real.

00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:10.450
A few days ago,

00:56:10.633 --> 00:56:14.788
I was walking by,
and I thought I saw the same one.

00:56:14.955 --> 00:56:16.457
I see.

00:56:19.376 --> 00:56:21.795
This place sells great coffee, doesn't it?

00:56:22.004 --> 00:56:23.422
- Pardon me?
- What?

00:56:25.257 --> 00:56:27.050
Well, I came here yesterday,

00:56:27.201 --> 00:56:30.554
and the coffee was so good
that I had to come back today.

00:56:32.790 --> 00:56:34.225
You're right.

00:56:34.541 --> 00:56:35.817
Would you like to order?

00:56:35.934 --> 00:56:37.644
Oh, order?

00:56:37.961 --> 00:56:40.648
Of course.
I should order something...

00:56:50.365 --> 00:56:51.908
Iced black coffee, please.

00:56:52.826 --> 00:56:54.411
Sir, this is a phone.

00:56:59.286 --> 00:57:01.401
- Do you want me to open it?
- Goodness.

00:57:21.088 --> 00:57:22.648
I guess I'm not mistaken.

00:57:30.097 --> 00:57:32.741
- You know, that customer...
- Who?

00:57:32.983 --> 00:57:34.075
Him.

00:57:34.601 --> 00:57:36.369
Oh, by the window?

00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:40.415
He's a little strange.
He's been glancing over at you.

00:57:41.541 --> 00:57:42.709
Has he?

00:57:44.970 --> 00:57:46.171
I'm positive.

00:57:46.613 --> 00:57:48.298
He's interested in you.

00:57:49.867 --> 00:57:51.867
Mind your own business,
and scoop some ice.

00:57:53.704 --> 00:57:55.556
What are you going to do
if he asks you out?

00:57:55.639 --> 00:57:57.433
Stop being silly!

00:57:57.516 --> 00:57:59.268
He's obviously way too young.

00:57:59.726 --> 00:58:01.394
Younger guys nowadays don't care
about that.

00:58:01.478 --> 00:58:02.945
Older-younger couples are trending
these days, you know.

00:58:03.028 --> 00:58:04.105
No, thanks.

00:58:06.133 --> 00:58:08.902
If you feel like he's not the one,
set clear boundaries, all right?

00:58:08.985 --> 00:58:11.405
Remember that stalker
who's been harassing you?

00:58:13.031 --> 00:58:14.324
Scoop some ice, please.

00:58:26.086 --> 00:58:28.630
Does she look pretty
because her name is Seol-ha

00:58:29.156 --> 00:58:31.091
or is she just a pretty girl

00:58:31.675 --> 00:58:33.427
whose name happens to be Seol-ha?

00:58:37.706 --> 00:58:38.765
Dude.

00:58:39.558 --> 00:58:41.810
- She's just insanely pretty.
- Is she pretty?

00:58:42.045 --> 00:58:44.062
Yes. She's like

00:58:44.354 --> 00:58:47.816
mature, grown-up...

00:58:49.468 --> 00:58:50.611
She's just pretty.

00:58:51.403 --> 00:58:53.238
So, he's like that because she's pretty.

00:58:55.974 --> 00:58:57.284
She certainly is pretty.

00:58:58.810 --> 00:59:01.579
It's true,
but I don't think that's the only reason.

00:59:01.897 --> 00:59:04.124
I think it is the only reason.

00:59:05.167 --> 00:59:07.294
It feels like her name is affecting me.

00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:10.922
But is it wrong to feel that way

00:59:11.239 --> 00:59:13.883
- just because of the name?
- Of course it is!

00:59:14.301 --> 00:59:16.595
It looks like I'm not over Kwon Seol-ha.

00:59:16.845 --> 00:59:18.845
- Are you sure you're over her?
- I am.

00:59:19.222 --> 00:59:20.473
Are you sure?

00:59:21.583 --> 00:59:22.893
I'm telling you.

00:59:23.902 --> 00:59:26.730
Then, it must have nothing to do
with Kwon Seol-ha.

00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:30.859
- Why don't you try talking to her?
- I can't! Her name is also Seol-ha.

00:59:31.735 --> 00:59:34.613
What are you talking about, you idiot?
So, what do you want to do?

00:59:35.238 --> 00:59:36.281
Gosh...

00:59:38.074 --> 00:59:39.242
I don't know.

00:59:42.104 --> 00:59:44.206
Jun-seok, what are we going to do
with Min-gi?

00:59:48.210 --> 00:59:49.253
Min-gi.

00:59:50.337 --> 00:59:52.130
Just follow your heart.

00:59:52.906 --> 00:59:54.007
What?

00:59:54.174 --> 00:59:56.885
No one will blame you
for following your heart.

01:00:42.597 --> 01:00:45.683
Would you like to order?

01:00:48.103 --> 01:00:49.229
I...

01:00:56.862 --> 01:00:58.906
I have to tell you something.
