THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION

00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:01.395
Can I ask you something?

00:01:04.682 --> 00:01:06.108
What is it?

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:12.530
Am I your first?

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:40.267
Ju-yeon!

00:01:41.293 --> 00:01:42.477
So Ju-yeon!

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.322
- I'll go this way.
- Thank you.

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:47.107
Ju-yeon! Where are you?

00:01:57.284 --> 00:01:58.660
Why can't I get reception?

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.542
Ju-yeon!

00:02:06.735 --> 00:02:08.003
Ju-yeon!

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.713
So Ju-yeon!

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:27.933
It's working.

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.487
Ju-yeon!

00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:35.906
So Ju-yeon!

00:02:36.815 --> 00:02:38.867
Answer me if you're there!

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:50.587
Ju-yeon!

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:53.715
So Ju-yeon!

00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:02.975
Sir!

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:05.310
Sir!

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:07.228
Help me!

00:03:08.547 --> 00:03:11.984
Help! Please help!

00:03:55.746 --> 00:03:58.048
Jun-seok, are you all right?

00:04:03.043 --> 00:04:05.203
- Jun-seok.
- Jun-seok!

00:04:06.088 --> 00:04:07.706
Noh Jun-seok!

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:10.250
Jun-seok!

00:04:11.176 --> 00:04:12.752
Noh Jun-seok!

00:04:14.404 --> 00:04:17.006
Ju-yeon? Ju-yeon!

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:18.883
Ju-yeon!

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:21.059
- Jun-seok!
- Be careful!

00:04:23.338 --> 00:04:24.806
Jun-seok!

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.475
- Oh, my gosh.
- I'll go find some rope.

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:30.145
- Don't come any closer!
- Wait.

00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:31.855
Stay there.

00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:34.774
- Jun-seok, grab my hand.
- Have you lost your mind?

00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:36.735
No, have you lost your mind?

00:04:37.035 --> 00:04:40.030
- Grab my hand!
- Listen to me!

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:41.697
Sir!

00:04:42.113 --> 00:04:43.325
Sir!

00:04:44.318 --> 00:04:46.161
Hey! Oh, no.

00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:48.538
Jun-seok, grab my hand.

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:50.416
Listen to me. Grab my hand...

00:04:56.138 --> 00:04:57.673
Help!

00:05:01.076 --> 00:05:02.260
Sir!

00:05:11.294 --> 00:05:12.145
Ju-yeon.

00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:16.616
The shirt you got me is completely ruined.

00:05:18.593 --> 00:05:20.194
Is that what you're worried about
right now?

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.240
Sir!

00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:24.908
Ju-yeon.

00:05:28.537 --> 00:05:30.038
If anything ever happens to me,

00:05:32.774 --> 00:05:34.774
will you break the news to my dad
and comfort him?

00:05:34.857 --> 00:05:36.857
Nothing's going to happen to you!

00:05:37.904 --> 00:05:39.904
I'm not going to deliver any news.

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:43.259
You tell him yourself!

00:05:43.869 --> 00:05:46.430
And stop crying because of Gyu-cheol!

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:48.932
When you cry because of him,

00:05:50.008 --> 00:05:51.851
it breaks my heart.

00:05:57.591 --> 00:05:58.817
I'm sorry.

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:00.985
Jun-seok, no.

00:06:01.785 --> 00:06:03.780
No!

00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:05.031
No.

00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:25.675
Are you all right? You're not hurt?

00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:41.359
Hey, the cliff wasn't that high.

00:06:43.178 --> 00:06:46.072
Yes, it was. It was pretty dangerous.

00:06:50.644 --> 00:06:51.870
Try getting up.

00:06:54.973 --> 00:06:56.249
Are you all right?

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:03.423
You're not all right.

00:07:03.782 --> 00:07:05.258
It hurts, doesn't it?

00:07:06.993 --> 00:07:10.013
- Is it bad?
- No, it doesn't hurt.

00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:14.767
It's all good. You're safe now.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.640
You're going to be all right.

00:07:27.522 --> 00:07:30.967
CRINGY ROMANCE

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.050
It's all going to be okay.

00:07:47.342 --> 00:07:48.927
Min-gi.

00:07:57.627 --> 00:07:58.853
Min-gi?

00:08:01.172 --> 00:08:02.440
Are you crying?

00:08:04.801 --> 00:08:06.152
Why are you crying?

00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:10.098
You're crying. What's the matter?

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:11.491
Why are you crying so much?

00:08:18.064 --> 00:08:19.540
You don't like me anymore?

00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:24.087
No.

00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:26.589
That's not it.

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:30.552
I knew...

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:35.015
that I could never be...

00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:38.143
your first.

00:08:40.362 --> 00:08:41.855
And I understand.

00:08:43.865 --> 00:08:46.734
But strangely, it makes me so upset.

00:08:47.385 --> 00:08:51.155
And if I...

00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:53.558
had been born before you,

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.100
met you first,

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.039
and like you first,
it would have been fine.

00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:01.441
You know...
Since we were little kids.

00:09:04.444 --> 00:09:07.672
But there's nothing I can do about that.

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:09.508
Right?

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:14.887
I still like you, though.

00:09:16.473 --> 00:09:17.933
I still like you.

00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:20.977
I like you so much.

00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:27.008
So, why do I keep crying like an idiot?

00:09:27.091 --> 00:09:28.109
Damn it.

00:09:28.192 --> 00:09:30.737
It's okay, Min-gi.

00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:35.198
- This sucks.
- Min-gi.

00:09:35.517 --> 00:09:36.977
Don't cry.

00:09:39.229 --> 00:09:42.832
It's so painful!

00:09:44.234 --> 00:09:45.919
My heart aches.

00:11:29.364 --> 00:11:30.982
Are you sure about this?

00:12:21.324 --> 00:12:22.450
Bye.

00:12:25.979 --> 00:12:29.357
So, Min-gi and his girlfriend are

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.001
in your room?

00:12:31.442 --> 00:12:34.170
Yes. I can just find a PC café
to sleep in.

00:12:36.298 --> 00:12:38.297
You can't go to a PC café
looking like that.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:39.380
It's fine.

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:42.410
- Come with me.
- But...

00:12:43.454 --> 00:12:44.638
But I'm fine.

00:12:53.047 --> 00:12:55.024
I'm telling you. It's okay.

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:09.664
- Does it sting?
- Yes.

00:13:09.823 --> 00:13:11.550
- Oh, no.
- Be gentle.

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:14.252
The wound is too deep.

00:13:17.322 --> 00:13:18.882
- Does it hurt?
- Well...

00:13:20.842 --> 00:13:22.344
What if you get a scar?

00:13:32.603 --> 00:13:35.481
Stop moving. It's not dry yet.

00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:49.433
What?

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:50.955
I heard that you knew

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:53.249
Gyu-cheol was cheating on me.

00:13:54.467 --> 00:13:55.543
What?

00:13:56.786 --> 00:13:59.505
- Right.
- I'm so disappointed in you.

00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:05.178
Shouldn't I matter more to you
than Gyu-cheol does?

00:14:07.405 --> 00:14:08.431
Sorry.

00:14:10.124 --> 00:14:11.475
It's too late for that.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.188
Let me see that.

00:14:22.662 --> 00:14:23.780
Done.

00:14:24.555 --> 00:14:26.991
- Does it still hurt?
- No.

00:14:27.809 --> 00:14:29.809
I'm worried you'll get a scar.

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:33.498
Get some sleep.

00:14:49.956 --> 00:14:52.267
It's okay. We'll try again next time.

00:14:55.728 --> 00:14:57.313
I'm usually not like this.

00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:04.278
It's because it's your first time.

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:12.810
I'm sure we can do it next time.

00:15:22.363 --> 00:15:23.464
Are you telling me...

00:15:24.257 --> 00:15:26.676
you couldn't do it?

00:15:26.935 --> 00:15:28.553
You're so frustrating.

00:15:28.952 --> 00:15:31.054
- Gosh.
- That's enough.

00:15:31.138 --> 00:15:32.226
But he's a man.

00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:34.331
I'm sure he feels worse.

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:38.938
Hey, it's all right.
You can get it treated at a clinic.

00:15:40.064 --> 00:15:41.524
You're meaner than him, dude.

00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:45.320
It's fine. We'll play video games
to forget about it.

00:15:45.803 --> 00:15:47.571
By the way, where's Jun-seok?

00:15:49.599 --> 00:15:51.367
I thought hard about it,

00:15:52.493 --> 00:15:54.370
and I think it's the smoking.

00:15:55.104 --> 00:15:57.940
See? It looks so limp.

00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:00.084
You guys should quit too.

00:16:03.071 --> 00:16:05.423
Good. You'll be strong now.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.133
Let's go.

00:16:13.706 --> 00:16:14.849
Wait for me.

00:16:31.641 --> 00:16:32.992
Ju-yeon!

00:16:33.292 --> 00:16:34.827
I'm home!

00:16:35.061 --> 00:16:37.246
- Ju-yeon?
- Yes.

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:43.336
Hey.

00:16:45.321 --> 00:16:46.964
I told you so.

00:16:47.073 --> 00:16:49.175
Of course, he's the culprit.

00:16:49.425 --> 00:16:50.593
Right?

00:16:51.511 --> 00:16:53.346
What do you mean, "How did you know?"

00:16:56.541 --> 00:16:58.059
- Jun-seok.
- What?

00:16:58.217 --> 00:16:59.643
- My dad's here.
- Holy shit!

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:02.689
Hide.

00:17:03.481 --> 00:17:06.985
Listen.
No parent ever suspects their child.

00:17:07.443 --> 00:17:09.695
That was what confused us.

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:16.185
Come on.

00:17:16.268 --> 00:17:19.705
I'm a profiler, after all.
Of course, I guessed it correctly.

00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:21.249
That's right.

00:17:21.499 --> 00:17:24.694
Yes, I know. If we ever get a chance

00:17:24.777 --> 00:17:27.839
to see each other at the station,
we'll talk more.

00:17:28.197 --> 00:17:30.197
Yes, I'll talk to you later.

00:17:30.741 --> 00:17:31.823
Jeez.

00:17:34.136 --> 00:17:35.304
Ju-yeon!

00:17:36.439 --> 00:17:37.974
Is she out?

00:17:39.584 --> 00:17:40.727
Ju-yeon!

00:17:41.277 --> 00:17:43.277
- What do we do?
- Ju-yeon.

00:17:43.629 --> 00:17:44.772
Are you in there?

00:17:45.189 --> 00:17:46.305
Did she leave--

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:48.109
Oh, my gosh.

00:17:48.468 --> 00:17:50.278
Why didn't you answer me
if you were home?

00:17:51.387 --> 00:17:52.738
Hey, Dad.

00:17:53.489 --> 00:17:55.157
Why are you back so early?

00:17:55.433 --> 00:17:58.453
Something came up at the police station.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.020
What are you still doing in bed?
It's so late.

00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:04.259
I had a fever, so I was sleeping.

00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:06.961
What? Are you feeling unwell?

00:18:07.628 --> 00:18:08.712
No.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.490
It's just a cold.

00:18:10.573 --> 00:18:13.051
That's called feeling unwell!

00:18:13.884 --> 00:18:15.219
How sick are you?

00:18:16.078 --> 00:18:19.290
No, Dad. I'm totally fine. Don't mind me.

00:18:19.373 --> 00:18:21.475
Stay still.

00:18:21.976 --> 00:18:24.896
Your face is all red.

00:18:25.187 --> 00:18:26.522
- Dad, just--
- Hang on.

00:18:26.714 --> 00:18:28.566
I think you have a fever too.

00:18:28.908 --> 00:18:31.193
I'm sure I'll be fine
once I get some sleep.

00:18:31.777 --> 00:18:33.028
Did you take medicine?

00:18:35.823 --> 00:18:39.118
Did you have to get sick while I was gone?

00:18:39.201 --> 00:18:40.703
It breaks my heart.

00:18:41.662 --> 00:18:44.164
I'm fine. I'll recover after some sleep.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:45.916
You should hurry and get to work.

00:18:46.627 --> 00:18:47.737
Right.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:51.757
You'll get over your cold
if you sweat it out under the covers.

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:53.841
Goodness.

00:19:01.315 --> 00:19:03.125
My goodness.

00:19:03.208 --> 00:19:07.104
Your feet are a perfect copy of mine.

00:19:07.563 --> 00:19:11.192
Just look at your broad soles.

00:19:11.717 --> 00:19:14.970
And the hairs on your big toe.
Your feet look exactly like mine.

00:19:27.249 --> 00:19:28.859
What are you doing, Dad?

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:31.044
Oh, boy.

00:19:33.698 --> 00:19:36.759
You grew up so fast.

00:19:38.953 --> 00:19:40.346
I was too busy

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:44.725
to realize how big your feet have gotten.

00:19:46.294 --> 00:19:47.687
Boy.

00:19:55.219 --> 00:19:57.154
Oh, gosh.

00:19:57.847 --> 00:20:01.117
Even the funky smell of your feet.

00:20:01.642 --> 00:20:03.018
- I love it.
- Dad.

00:20:03.101 --> 00:20:05.245
What are you doing? That's gross.

00:20:05.328 --> 00:20:08.749
What do you mean by "gross?"
Don't you remember?

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.944
When you were little,
I used to come home after work

00:20:12.027 --> 00:20:15.448
and kiss and massage your feet every day.

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.300
- You don't remember?
- Dad, stop.

00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:26.684
What was that sound?

00:20:31.047 --> 00:20:33.483
Ju-yeon, you little brat.

00:20:35.526 --> 00:20:37.194
Did you fart?

00:20:38.596 --> 00:20:41.782
Your fart stinks, Ju-yeon!

00:20:42.516 --> 00:20:43.784
Dad, I'm sleepy.

00:20:43.918 --> 00:20:45.328
All right.

00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:48.789
- Stinky fart.
- Dad!

00:20:48.872 --> 00:20:51.583
- Dad!
- It stinks.

00:20:52.376 --> 00:20:53.627
I'm sleepy.

00:20:56.756 --> 00:20:58.091
I'll leave you alone.

00:21:04.955 --> 00:21:06.139
You can come out now.

00:21:09.085 --> 00:21:10.353
That was wild.

00:21:19.403 --> 00:21:20.487
Are you okay?

00:21:20.871 --> 00:21:22.447
I almost suffocated to death.

00:21:24.684 --> 00:21:27.495
Your dad loves you so much.

00:21:28.229 --> 00:21:29.539
He does.

00:21:29.747 --> 00:21:31.374
You could have died if he had seen you.

00:21:31.774 --> 00:21:33.292
- Gosh.
- It's so hot.

00:21:33.726 --> 00:21:35.726
HIDEOUT BAR

00:21:40.991 --> 00:21:42.593
- Gi-hyeok!
- Hey.

00:21:42.785 --> 00:21:44.929
- Did you wait long?
- No, I just got here.

00:21:54.088 --> 00:21:55.314
This is so nice.

00:21:57.258 --> 00:21:58.484
What is?

00:21:59.985 --> 00:22:01.153
You know,

00:22:01.762 --> 00:22:04.865
going to watch late-night movies
with you after work.

00:22:05.224 --> 00:22:06.325
Things like that.

00:22:09.186 --> 00:22:11.186
You're hungry, right?
Why don't we grab something to eat?

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:14.082
Let's get hot dogs at the movies.

00:22:14.165 --> 00:22:16.419
Now, I'm into eating hot dogs
at the movie theater.

00:22:17.044 --> 00:22:18.254
Sure.

00:22:19.697 --> 00:22:21.321
Taxi!

00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:25.886
- Come on.
- Okay.

00:22:30.349 --> 00:22:31.517
Thanks.

00:22:32.184 --> 00:22:34.061
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:22:36.856 --> 00:22:37.899
Get in.

00:22:38.224 --> 00:22:39.316
Right.

00:22:51.412 --> 00:22:52.496
Gi-hyeok.

00:22:53.506 --> 00:22:56.792
Why didn't you tell me
you had such a pretty friend?

00:23:01.947 --> 00:23:03.632
You don't tell people about me, do you?

00:23:04.784 --> 00:23:06.552
No, it's not like that.

00:23:08.929 --> 00:23:10.013
Hey.

00:23:10.431 --> 00:23:11.724
Can I ask you

00:23:12.666 --> 00:23:13.976
what your name is?

00:23:14.977 --> 00:23:16.937
You don't have to use
the honorifics, ma'am.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.355
But...

00:23:18.923 --> 00:23:20.524
we've only just met.

00:23:21.525 --> 00:23:22.609
Should I drop the honorifics?

00:23:24.345 --> 00:23:26.222
I'm Hui-seon. Choi Hui-seon.

00:23:26.347 --> 00:23:29.074
Choi Hui-seon?
What a pretty name you have.

00:23:34.814 --> 00:23:35.915
Do you mind

00:23:36.565 --> 00:23:38.959
if I call you Mother?

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.380
Of course. If we get closer,

00:23:43.047 --> 00:23:44.840
you can even call me your sister

00:23:44.949 --> 00:23:46.949
or your mom, even.

00:23:47.115 --> 00:23:48.164
I'm sorry?

00:23:49.787 --> 00:23:51.305
You can call me whatever you want.

00:23:51.397 --> 00:23:53.057
- Come on, Mom.
- What?

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:57.144
It's better than "Auntie."
I hate it when your friends call me that.

00:23:57.545 --> 00:23:59.063
You're making her uncomfortable.

00:23:59.146 --> 00:24:01.340
What do you mean?
I'd love to call her my mom.

00:24:01.423 --> 00:24:03.609
Right? I don't make you
uncomfortable, do I?

00:24:03.692 --> 00:24:05.069
Not at all.

00:24:05.153 --> 00:24:06.612
See?

00:24:07.555 --> 00:24:09.323
Hui-seon, your mom must be so proud

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.909
to have such a friendly daughter.

00:24:13.102 --> 00:24:14.995
I can tell that you grew up
in a loving environment.

00:24:15.829 --> 00:24:18.165
I love your smile,

00:24:18.749 --> 00:24:21.126
and you have such an affectionate tone.

00:24:21.318 --> 00:24:23.920
Your parents must be so proud. Am I right?

00:24:25.172 --> 00:24:26.465
Yes.

00:24:33.622 --> 00:24:34.765
- Mom.
- Yes?

00:24:35.057 --> 00:24:37.017
We're almost there.
You can drop us off there.

00:24:37.226 --> 00:24:40.104
Over there? Yes, I'll drop you off there.

00:24:48.645 --> 00:24:51.907
CINEMA TOWN

00:24:52.433 --> 00:24:54.035
Here we are.

00:24:54.118 --> 00:24:55.870
- Thanks, Mom.
- Thank you!

00:25:00.624 --> 00:25:01.959
Take care.

00:25:02.276 --> 00:25:04.444
Visit our house
when you're free next time.

00:25:04.528 --> 00:25:05.572
I'll cook for you.

00:25:05.779 --> 00:25:07.798
Mom, stop making her uncomfortable.

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:11.593
What's so uncomfortable with cooking food
for my son's friend? Am I right?

00:25:11.702 --> 00:25:13.220
Of course.

00:25:13.721 --> 00:25:15.014
We're late. You should go.

00:25:15.162 --> 00:25:16.306
All right.

00:25:16.389 --> 00:25:17.891
- Have fun!
- Take care.

00:25:17.975 --> 00:25:19.268
- Okay.
- Bye.

00:25:24.398 --> 00:25:25.691
I can't believe this.

00:25:25.841 --> 00:25:27.484
Why did it have to be my mom's taxi?

00:25:28.193 --> 00:25:30.445
I'm sorry if it was uncomfortable.

00:25:31.513 --> 00:25:32.948
Do I really look like that?

00:25:33.282 --> 00:25:34.283
What?

00:25:34.658 --> 00:25:38.370
Does it look like I was raised
in a loving environment?

00:25:39.647 --> 00:25:40.706
What?

00:25:42.466 --> 00:25:46.211
So far, people have only told me

00:25:46.294 --> 00:25:47.754
that I had a troubled look

00:25:48.614 --> 00:25:50.174
with a shadow on my face.

00:25:50.532 --> 00:25:52.532
What are you talking about?

00:25:52.801 --> 00:25:55.762
Who said that to you? Who?

00:25:58.974 --> 00:26:00.058
Let's get going.

00:26:02.136 --> 00:26:03.228
Okay.

00:26:09.259 --> 00:26:11.259
Jun-seok.

00:26:12.262 --> 00:26:14.717
Gyu-cheol cheated on me.

00:26:14.801 --> 00:26:15.827
Where are you now?

00:26:16.892 --> 00:26:18.892
Okay. I'm on my way there.

00:26:20.312 --> 00:26:22.147
Come on. Stop crying.

00:26:37.721 --> 00:26:40.098
Now, Ms. Yun Seol-ha,

00:26:40.474 --> 00:26:44.103
which do you value more?
Your career or your personal life?

00:26:44.294 --> 00:26:46.521
I value my career more.

00:26:48.048 --> 00:26:49.775
Do you really?

00:26:50.926 --> 00:26:53.053
- Why?
- So, when we're on a date,

00:26:53.136 --> 00:26:54.947
you're going to leave me
if something comes up?

00:26:55.531 --> 00:26:57.742
Min-gi, this is supposed to be
a job interview.

00:26:57.825 --> 00:26:58.976
Oh, you're right.

00:26:59.059 --> 00:27:00.311
- Here you go.
- Calm down.

00:27:00.394 --> 00:27:02.580
- Thank you.
- That looks tasty. Thank you.

00:27:03.914 --> 00:27:05.124
Why? Did she say no?

00:27:05.707 --> 00:27:06.958
She has plans that day.

00:27:07.125 --> 00:27:09.044
Really? That's bad news.

00:27:09.361 --> 00:27:11.004
Are you sure you'll be fine on your own?

00:27:11.405 --> 00:27:12.504
What is it?

00:27:12.588 --> 00:27:14.616
Are you trying to find someone
to cover for you on that day?

00:27:14.699 --> 00:27:16.551
- I'll fill in for you.
- Seriously?

00:27:16.718 --> 00:27:17.677
You're free that day?

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:20.322
What's the point of having a boyfriend?

00:27:20.748 --> 00:27:23.392
You can always ask me
if you need to move heavy things.

00:27:23.475 --> 00:27:26.270
I'm stronger than I look.

00:27:27.171 --> 00:27:28.355
See?

00:27:28.438 --> 00:27:31.050
Min-gi just knows what to say.

00:27:31.133 --> 00:27:32.234
Give me a kiss.

00:27:32.593 --> 00:27:34.987
- Come on.
- You're a lifesaver. Thanks, Min-gi.

00:27:35.095 --> 00:27:38.365
Baby, don't worry a thing about that.
Just focus on the interview.

00:27:38.448 --> 00:27:41.076
- All right, honey?
- Yes, honey.

00:27:41.159 --> 00:27:42.911
You can leave us alone now.
I need to practice for my interview.

00:27:42.994 --> 00:27:45.956
All right.
We don't have time to joke around.

00:27:46.398 --> 00:27:48.751
- Okay.
- Moving on to the next question.

00:27:49.418 --> 00:27:52.713
What has been the most difficult challenge
in your life,

00:27:52.796 --> 00:27:54.798
and how did you overcome it?

00:27:59.136 --> 00:28:00.346
Last night?

00:28:01.513 --> 00:28:03.557
Min-gi, wait!

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.100
I'm joking!

00:28:05.538 --> 00:28:07.419
I have to stop here, right?

00:28:07.503 --> 00:28:09.503
- Yes. And then...
- I lock it here.

00:28:09.586 --> 00:28:12.232
- Okay. I got it.
- Right here.

00:28:12.674 --> 00:28:14.484
- What about my legs? Just one foot?
- Forward.

00:28:14.567 --> 00:28:16.386
- Like that. And do this.
- Okay.

00:28:16.469 --> 00:28:18.071
Oh, right. I always forget.

00:28:18.305 --> 00:28:20.582
- Right?
- Why do I keep forgetting?

00:28:20.665 --> 00:28:22.665
I just can't get this right.

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:24.120
I just can't.

00:28:24.203 --> 00:28:25.983
Hey, Yeon-jeong.

00:28:26.067 --> 00:28:27.689
Chae-yeong!

00:28:27.772 --> 00:28:31.501
What's up with you, girl?

00:28:34.863 --> 00:28:37.591
- Do you go to clubs together?
- What?

00:28:37.674 --> 00:28:40.010
It's just that you haven't been around.

00:28:40.227 --> 00:28:41.803
Stay out of this.

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:44.640
You're drunk, aren't you? That's cute.

00:28:46.975 --> 00:28:50.604
So, what's up? You never call me.

00:28:50.896 --> 00:28:53.232
I called you,
but it was a non-working number.

00:28:53.966 --> 00:28:55.276
Did you get a new phone?

00:28:55.717 --> 00:28:57.717
Yes, it's been some time
since I changed my phone.

00:29:00.072 --> 00:29:01.907
Didn't I tell you my new number?

00:29:03.659 --> 00:29:06.078
Sorry. I must have forgotten.
I'll tell you now.

00:29:07.437 --> 00:29:09.789
Oh, that's why you never texted back.

00:29:18.037 --> 00:29:19.077
I'll save it.

00:29:31.954 --> 00:29:34.606
- Use one leg only.
- You're really good.

00:29:34.689 --> 00:29:36.689
Why can't I do it naturally?

00:29:36.842 --> 00:29:38.842
- Gosh. Just my wrists?
- And turn your wrists.

00:29:39.595 --> 00:29:41.163
One and two.

00:29:41.246 --> 00:29:43.246
- One and two.
- And point.

00:29:48.036 --> 00:29:49.329
Yeon-jeong.

00:29:50.397 --> 00:29:52.541
You're doing it again.

00:29:53.275 --> 00:29:55.099
Your face when you dance.

00:29:55.183 --> 00:29:57.296
Why do you do this?

00:29:59.339 --> 00:30:01.216
That's so weird.

00:30:02.017 --> 00:30:05.479
It's so cringe.
Don't you agree, Gwang-jae?

00:30:05.562 --> 00:30:06.813
It's cringe, right?

00:30:11.777 --> 00:30:15.739
But you're supposed to smile a bit
when you're locking, so...

00:30:15.822 --> 00:30:18.066
I know that.

00:30:18.508 --> 00:30:19.692
I know.

00:30:20.135 --> 00:30:22.571
That's not what I mean.

00:30:23.263 --> 00:30:25.263
I'm saying it doesn't suit her.

00:30:25.346 --> 00:30:27.659
It's so cringeworthy.

00:30:28.577 --> 00:30:30.788
She always has that depressed look
on her face.

00:30:32.856 --> 00:30:34.299
Sorry, Yeon-jeong.

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:37.127
I'm not trying to say that you're ugly.

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:39.363
That's definitely not true.

00:30:40.347 --> 00:30:41.782
You don't get it.

00:30:41.865 --> 00:30:44.117
You should have seen her
when she was in high school.

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:47.846
Her face was depressed as heck.

00:30:49.164 --> 00:30:52.292
Oh, I get it now.
You tend to do that to close friends.

00:30:52.375 --> 00:30:53.919
I know what that's like.
But you know what?

00:30:54.002 --> 00:30:56.002
From an objective point of view,
it's not weird at all.

00:30:56.085 --> 00:30:57.355
You look so cool.

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.860
Yes, I'm the asshole.

00:31:06.014 --> 00:31:08.492
- Come on. Let's just drink.
- Go away.

00:31:16.984 --> 00:31:20.421
Yeon-jeong, do that little dance again.

00:31:21.305 --> 00:31:22.589
You know? Like this.

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:24.466
Chae-yeong, you're drunk.

00:31:29.538 --> 00:31:33.225
Oh, please. Do that little dance again.
Just once.

00:31:34.768 --> 00:31:36.436
- Do it.
- Kim Chae-yeong.

00:31:38.964 --> 00:31:40.607
You're being really rude to her.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.698
I don't believe this.

00:31:49.116 --> 00:31:50.576
Why do you care?

00:31:52.936 --> 00:31:55.239
Just go home. You're being obnoxious.

00:32:04.489 --> 00:32:05.799
Moron.

00:32:06.266 --> 00:32:07.676
I wouldn't stay, even if you begged me.

00:32:08.885 --> 00:32:10.637
You're always chasing after anyone,
anyway.

00:32:10.829 --> 00:32:13.056
Did you wash your hair with beer
or something?

00:32:13.915 --> 00:32:16.559
You look freaking lame. Do you know that?

00:32:16.752 --> 00:32:19.313
- Chae-yeong.
- Don't touch me!

00:32:22.007 --> 00:32:24.609
Damn it. Don't get cocky with me.

00:32:24.692 --> 00:32:26.028
Hey, Skidmark.

00:32:27.404 --> 00:32:29.656
Did you honestly think I was your friend
just because I hung out with you?

00:32:29.739 --> 00:32:32.075
- That's enough.
- Get off me.

00:32:40.317 --> 00:32:43.337
Not once did I ever consider you a friend.

00:32:47.182 --> 00:32:49.182
Are you being serious?

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:52.262
Get your hands off me!

00:33:04.357 --> 00:33:05.817
Get out of my face.

00:33:37.015 --> 00:33:38.266
I'm sorry.

00:33:39.768 --> 00:33:41.311
It's my fault.

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:45.148
Does it look like

00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:48.276
I washed it with beer to you too?

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:49.903
What?

00:33:51.071 --> 00:33:52.447
My hair, I mean.

00:33:55.075 --> 00:33:57.536
No, not at all.

00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:00.497
That's a trend in the US.

00:34:00.647 --> 00:34:02.165
I knew you'd know!

00:34:02.249 --> 00:34:05.661
Of course, I do.
Eminem also has that hair color.

00:34:05.744 --> 00:34:07.295
Tell me about it!

00:34:07.387 --> 00:34:09.047
It kept gnawing at me

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:11.132
after she said
it looked like I washed it with beer.

00:34:11.341 --> 00:34:12.759
Seriously.

00:34:17.802 --> 00:34:19.987
It's an American style.

00:34:20.317 --> 00:34:21.851
She doesn't get it.

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:23.744
- Hold on.
- What?

00:34:36.683 --> 00:34:38.118
That's smart.

00:34:39.369 --> 00:34:40.579
Thanks.

00:34:46.343 --> 00:34:48.837
I listened to that CD by... Was it Sisoo?

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.338
It was so good.

00:34:51.422 --> 00:34:54.675
- Do you mean Sisqó?
- Yes, Sisqó.

00:34:54.759 --> 00:34:57.262
- His songs are so good, right?
- How did you know about him?

00:34:57.396 --> 00:35:00.390
- A friend from my dance club told me.
- Really?

00:35:24.214 --> 00:35:27.083
Stop moving. It's not dry yet.

00:35:52.801 --> 00:35:54.027
You have big hands.

00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:58.592
I'm telling you!

00:36:58.675 --> 00:37:02.079
Don't just be nice to us when we're here.
Answer our calls once in a while.

00:37:02.162 --> 00:37:04.398
- He's right.
- That way, I can buy some drinks here.

00:37:04.481 --> 00:37:06.333
- Or we can all go outside and drink.
- Yes.

00:37:06.417 --> 00:37:09.478
- We should drink soju outside.
- Yes, just today.

00:37:10.086 --> 00:37:12.230
Hey, what are you thinking about?

00:37:14.474 --> 00:37:17.151
- Shoot.
- Oh, my gosh.

00:37:17.302 --> 00:37:19.404
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

00:37:19.821 --> 00:37:21.030
- Go to the back.
- Gosh, what the hell?

00:37:21.114 --> 00:37:23.081
- Damn it, this hurts.
- Oh, dear.

00:37:23.616 --> 00:37:26.327
- Damn it.
- I'm terribly sorry.

00:37:27.562 --> 00:37:29.831
- Gosh.
- Let me see that.

00:37:30.215 --> 00:37:32.917
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

00:37:33.652 --> 00:37:35.879
She was feeling unwell today,

00:37:36.171 --> 00:37:38.171
but I made her come to work.

00:37:38.281 --> 00:37:40.975
- She should have taken a day off, then.
- I know!

00:37:41.058 --> 00:37:43.845
It's all my fault. I'm so sorry.

00:38:31.292 --> 00:38:34.153
You look amazing in a suit!

00:38:34.236 --> 00:38:36.439
It feels a bit awkward
wearing a suit again after so long.

00:38:39.042 --> 00:38:40.735
How do I look? Do you like it?

00:38:41.369 --> 00:38:42.470
I love it.

00:38:43.571 --> 00:38:44.989
This is your type, isn't it?

00:38:45.181 --> 00:38:46.241
Yes.

00:38:47.449 --> 00:38:51.246
No, I just meant
that you looked good in it.

00:38:52.455 --> 00:38:54.582
Oh, right. Let's go to this...

00:38:54.791 --> 00:38:57.085
after your interview today.

00:38:57.168 --> 00:38:58.928
LOTTE WORLD, ALL-DAY PASS

00:38:59.011 --> 00:39:00.130
Wait.

00:39:00.213 --> 00:39:01.589
You remembered?

00:39:01.806 --> 00:39:03.157
- What do you mean?
- What's this about?

00:39:05.101 --> 00:39:07.970
- I love you so much, Min-gi.
- What is it?

00:39:08.053 --> 00:39:10.890
I told him that I had never been
to Lotte World since high school.

00:39:12.058 --> 00:39:13.476
How attentive you are.

00:39:13.559 --> 00:39:15.812
Anyway, let's go there after
your interview.

00:39:16.771 --> 00:39:18.898
All right. I'm going to kill it.

00:39:18.981 --> 00:39:21.150
- You've got this.
- I'm running late. Bye.

00:39:21.233 --> 00:39:22.786
- You can do it!
- I can do it.

00:39:22.869 --> 00:39:24.095
- Good luck.
- You got this.

00:39:24.178 --> 00:39:25.060
I'll see you later.

00:39:27.448 --> 00:39:28.699
Why am I so nervous?

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:34.581
Seol-ha!

00:39:35.873 --> 00:39:36.999
Yes?

00:39:37.484 --> 00:39:38.502
Good luck!

00:39:43.406 --> 00:39:44.590
I'll see you tonight.

00:39:53.124 --> 00:39:55.124
- Ms. Yun Seol-ha?
- Yes.

00:39:56.377 --> 00:39:58.813
You were a team leader at YT Company.

00:39:59.455 --> 00:40:01.758
- Yes.
- That's impressive.

00:40:01.841 --> 00:40:03.734
The head of a team at the age of 26.

00:40:04.093 --> 00:40:06.445
Yes. I had worked there as an intern...

00:40:06.528 --> 00:40:08.697
since I was a college sophomore.

00:40:10.783 --> 00:40:12.076
You must be competent.

00:40:12.477 --> 00:40:13.703
Thank you.

00:40:17.607 --> 00:40:20.168
Yeo-jin, do you need me to do
anything else before I leave?

00:40:20.251 --> 00:40:23.504
No, you've done all you could.
Thanks for today. Get ready to leave.

00:40:24.005 --> 00:40:25.465
Are you going straight to Lotte World?

00:40:25.549 --> 00:40:28.176
Yes, I'm supposed to meet her
at the front gate.

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:29.802
She must be so excited.

00:40:30.353 --> 00:40:32.722
- Hello.
- Can I get a pancake?

00:40:32.805 --> 00:40:35.183
That will be five dollars.
I'll bring it to your table.

00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:37.685
- I'll get going.
- Bye.

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:42.940
Wait. You can't park there.

00:40:44.884 --> 00:40:46.884
Sir, you can't park there.

00:40:46.967 --> 00:40:48.321
I just need to bring this in.

00:40:48.404 --> 00:40:50.114
Oh, hi.

00:40:50.365 --> 00:40:51.658
I'll take that.

00:40:53.918 --> 00:40:55.918
These are Brazilian coffee beans.

00:40:56.079 --> 00:40:58.123
- You can give them to the owner.
- You were

00:40:58.648 --> 00:41:01.918
Seol-ha's supervisor
at her previous company, right?

00:41:02.351 --> 00:41:04.351
Pardon? What...

00:41:07.507 --> 00:41:08.933
Oh, right.

00:41:09.023 --> 00:41:10.760
- At the soju bar, right?
- Yes.

00:41:10.843 --> 00:41:12.512
- You were with Seol-ha.
- I was.

00:41:12.595 --> 00:41:14.222
- It's nice to see you.
- Hello.

00:41:14.397 --> 00:41:17.308
Didn't she come to work today?

00:41:17.667 --> 00:41:19.435
Oh, she's at a job interview.

00:41:19.852 --> 00:41:21.395
Oh, an interview?

00:41:22.463 --> 00:41:25.357
Do you know which company it is?

00:41:27.026 --> 00:41:29.095
It was "Brill" something.

00:41:29.429 --> 00:41:31.573
Is it Brilliant Communications?

00:41:31.764 --> 00:41:34.075
Oh, yes. That's the one.

00:41:35.076 --> 00:41:36.494
But...

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.913
how do you know her?

00:41:39.706 --> 00:41:41.082
I'm her boyfriend.

00:41:41.733 --> 00:41:43.733
- Boyfriend?
- Yes.

00:41:44.127 --> 00:41:45.128
Like a lover?

00:41:45.653 --> 00:41:47.296
Yes, a lover.

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.008
You were also a part
of the Zeus Card project?

00:41:51.784 --> 00:41:52.927
Yes.

00:41:53.202 --> 00:41:56.305
Did you know
that our company also entered a bid?

00:41:57.557 --> 00:41:59.557
- Yes.
- We lost that

00:41:59.767 --> 00:42:01.268
in the final stage, didn't we?

00:42:03.771 --> 00:42:06.983
YT Company pulled some strings,
and we got totally screwed.

00:42:09.819 --> 00:42:12.989
Your recent submission for Zeus Card
went through.

00:42:13.656 --> 00:42:16.576
Didn't you say the feedback
in the second round wasn't that positive?

00:42:17.644 --> 00:42:19.996
I talked to their CEO while playing golf.

00:42:20.413 --> 00:42:22.413
And they actually accepted it?

00:42:22.496 --> 00:42:24.876
And they actually accepted it.

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:27.529
Anyway, once this goes through,

00:42:29.088 --> 00:42:30.381
you're becoming a team leader.

00:42:31.199 --> 00:42:33.076
I can't be a team leader already.

00:42:33.159 --> 00:42:36.346
- I've just joined the company.
- It's my decision since I'm the boss.

00:42:37.972 --> 00:42:40.433
But I said I'd handle it
with my abilities.

00:42:40.516 --> 00:42:43.294
Just get ready to pick up the tab
for being a team leader.

00:42:44.295 --> 00:42:47.648
Mika World, Lyon Croissant,
Sangpyeong Bank...

00:42:48.775 --> 00:42:51.578
You took part
in all of their advertising campaigns?

00:42:52.403 --> 00:42:53.613
I did.

00:42:54.088 --> 00:42:58.159
Can you elaborate
on your roles in those campaigns?

00:42:59.519 --> 00:43:03.498
Well, I merely participated in them

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:07.210
as a member of the team.

00:43:07.627 --> 00:43:10.713
How did you become a team leader
if that was all you did?

00:43:10.922 --> 00:43:12.257
At the age of 26, at that.

00:43:14.867 --> 00:43:16.260
Well...

00:43:22.517 --> 00:43:25.979
This industry is smaller than you think.
Word gets around fast.

00:43:27.522 --> 00:43:30.024
You might have been better off
not listing all that experience.

00:43:30.466 --> 00:43:32.735
At your age, such an impressive resume

00:43:33.136 --> 00:43:35.321
is bound to raise some doubts.

00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:40.868
Yong-taek.

00:43:41.811 --> 00:43:44.413
- Hey.
- Give me a moment.

00:43:46.899 --> 00:43:48.000
- Here you go.
- Gosh.

00:43:51.963 --> 00:43:53.963
What brings you here?

00:43:54.048 --> 00:43:56.048
The coffee beans.

00:43:56.242 --> 00:43:58.844
Oh, the beans! You didn't have to.
Thank you.

00:44:00.429 --> 00:44:02.429
Right. I see that Seol-ha

00:44:03.099 --> 00:44:04.517
has a boyfriend now.

00:44:07.436 --> 00:44:08.687
Yes.

00:44:16.988 --> 00:44:18.656
This industry is smaller than you think.

00:44:18.848 --> 00:44:20.575
Word gets around fast.

00:44:20.811 --> 00:44:23.063
At your age, such an impressive resume

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:25.413
is bound to raise some doubts.

00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:09.040
What's going on?

00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:13.419
Did the interview not go well?

00:45:13.502 --> 00:45:15.171
It went well.

00:45:15.963 --> 00:45:17.131
Let's go.

00:45:23.412 --> 00:45:24.847
Shoot.

00:45:32.521 --> 00:45:33.605
Hey, Yeon-jeong!

00:45:33.688 --> 00:45:36.150
- Hey. Why are you here so early?
- Hey!

00:45:36.776 --> 00:45:39.487
- Why is the line so long?
- It's because of that.

00:45:39.823 --> 00:45:42.367
It's the club's second anniversary,
so they're giving out free drinks.

00:45:43.624 --> 00:45:46.243
I've been waiting
since 4 p.m. or something.

00:45:46.326 --> 00:45:47.286
- Since 4 p.m.?
- Yes.

00:45:47.369 --> 00:45:50.497
My, gosh. That must have been tough.

00:45:51.198 --> 00:45:52.449
Where's my ID?

00:45:54.168 --> 00:45:55.711
Thank you.

00:45:56.963 --> 00:45:59.424
Thank you.

00:45:59.574 --> 00:46:00.842
All right.

00:46:01.509 --> 00:46:03.509
- What's this?
- It's a lottery ticket.

00:46:03.786 --> 00:46:04.970
A lottery ticket?

00:46:05.805 --> 00:46:07.598
- Here.
- All right.

00:46:07.774 --> 00:46:09.642
- Thank you.
- Have fun.

00:46:30.566 --> 00:46:31.566
Let's go.

00:47:16.175 --> 00:47:17.543
Let's go, Seol-ha.

00:47:21.514 --> 00:47:22.924
Sorry!

00:47:23.799 --> 00:47:25.009
Are you okay?

00:47:27.995 --> 00:47:30.222
- I'll get you some napkins.
- That's fine.

00:47:30.305 --> 00:47:31.765
- I'll just go to the restroom.
- But...

00:47:31.999 --> 00:47:33.058
the napkins--

00:47:37.229 --> 00:47:38.605
Okay.

00:47:40.816 --> 00:47:41.942
Here you go.

00:47:42.677 --> 00:47:43.861
You know what to do.

00:47:44.128 --> 00:47:45.363
Hold it.

00:47:48.824 --> 00:47:50.117
That looks good.

00:47:50.701 --> 00:47:52.369
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:47:58.667 --> 00:48:00.252
Should we get some more shots?

00:48:00.669 --> 00:48:03.130
Let's take a short break.
We've been drinking too fast.

00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:04.506
That's true.

00:48:04.882 --> 00:48:06.008
Gosh.

00:48:07.009 --> 00:48:09.261
Right. Let's scratch this.

00:48:09.829 --> 00:48:12.431
- The ticket.
- Wait. I have some coins.

00:48:12.514 --> 00:48:14.225
Coins? Great.

00:48:15.293 --> 00:48:17.478
- Here.
- Okay. I'll scratch mine.

00:48:22.717 --> 00:48:23.901
- Darn it.
- Gosh.

00:48:24.151 --> 00:48:25.278
It's a dud.

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:26.612
Hold on.

00:48:29.907 --> 00:48:31.075
Try mine.

00:48:31.742 --> 00:48:32.827
Here goes nothing.

00:48:34.328 --> 00:48:36.914
Oh, it's red! I see red letters!

00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:39.708
We got it.

00:48:40.676 --> 00:48:41.819
What is it?

00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:43.546
What?

00:48:44.064 --> 00:48:45.074
What does it say?

00:48:45.306 --> 00:48:47.091
1 NIGHT AT HONGIN THEMED MOTEL

00:48:47.174 --> 00:48:49.468
VALID FOR 2 WEEKS FROM THE WINNING DATE,
1ST PLACE: 1 NIGHT AT HONGIN THEMED MOTEL

00:48:54.014 --> 00:48:55.057
What...

00:48:56.417 --> 00:48:59.061
What kind of prize is this?

00:48:59.144 --> 00:49:00.438
It's very...

00:49:04.316 --> 00:49:06.985
- It's the first prize, though.
- It is.

00:49:09.722 --> 00:49:11.101
Where are we going?

00:49:11.184 --> 00:49:12.867
You said you wanted
to go on a roller-coaster ride.

00:49:13.117 --> 00:49:14.785
But the roller coaster is that way.

00:49:22.902 --> 00:49:25.171
What's the matter with you? Tell me.

00:49:27.456 --> 00:49:29.132
Is it because I'm not having much fun?

00:49:31.535 --> 00:49:33.804
Min-gi, today has actually been...

00:49:34.246 --> 00:49:35.430
It was a bit--

00:49:39.685 --> 00:49:41.353
You used to date him, right?

00:49:46.919 --> 00:49:50.481
Why didn't you tell me the guy we met
at the soju bar was your ex?

00:49:53.849 --> 00:49:56.952
We weren't dating at the time.

00:50:05.711 --> 00:50:07.410
Then, you should have called him
and told him

00:50:07.494 --> 00:50:09.608
that you got a new boyfriend
after we started dating.

00:50:10.449 --> 00:50:13.077
How would I tell him
when we never ran into each other?

00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:16.096
You should have at least called him
and told him you had a new boyfriend!

00:50:26.799 --> 00:50:30.444
Don't get mad. I'm sorry. Okay?

00:50:32.955 --> 00:50:34.698
Let's not do this here.

00:50:36.367 --> 00:50:37.977
Not today.

00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:40.246
It's been too tough today.
The interview was--

00:50:40.329 --> 00:50:42.123
Tough? What is?

00:50:43.274 --> 00:50:44.959
What's so tough?

00:50:45.776 --> 00:50:47.211
How are you so selfish?

00:50:48.904 --> 00:50:49.922
What do you mean?

00:50:50.965 --> 00:50:52.717
You only care about your feelings,
don't you?

00:50:55.202 --> 00:50:56.720
Do you even care how I feel?

00:50:59.682 --> 00:51:01.184
Have I always been...

00:51:03.352 --> 00:51:05.104
selfish around you?

00:51:07.131 --> 00:51:08.482
Yes.

00:51:14.555 --> 00:51:15.739
I see.

00:51:19.643 --> 00:51:21.203
I'm sorry if I have.

00:51:25.624 --> 00:51:27.084
I'm sorry I've been selfish.

00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:53.068
Hui-seon, come and take a seat.

00:51:53.736 --> 00:51:54.846
Okay.

00:52:01.410 --> 00:52:03.787
I wired your monthly pay
to your bank account.

00:52:06.874 --> 00:52:08.459
Here. Take it.

00:52:09.985 --> 00:52:12.129
- What is it?
- It's your severance pay.

00:52:13.139 --> 00:52:14.632
You've done well so far.

00:52:15.458 --> 00:52:18.469
I didn't know you gave out severance pay.

00:52:20.538 --> 00:52:22.098
What are you going to do when you quit?

00:52:24.250 --> 00:52:26.102
I'm going to find a vocational school.

00:52:26.835 --> 00:52:28.270
And study for the GED.

00:52:28.479 --> 00:52:29.730
Unbelievable.

00:52:30.339 --> 00:52:33.275
Funny how you didn't care at all
when I told you to do that.

00:52:33.734 --> 00:52:35.194
I know, right?

00:52:35.286 --> 00:52:38.447
Gi-hyeok has done the impossible.
You should thank him.

00:52:38.572 --> 00:52:41.158
It's not entirely because of him.

00:52:42.159 --> 00:52:43.994
I was planning on doing this someday.

00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:47.581
I kept telling myself, "Someday,"

00:52:48.999 --> 00:52:50.025
and look what I've become.

00:52:50.751 --> 00:52:51.961
Just a bar hostess.

00:52:52.278 --> 00:52:55.298
What are you talking about?
What's so wrong with what you do?

00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:56.713
Jeez.

00:53:00.311 --> 00:53:02.138
But I had fun while I was working here.

00:53:03.597 --> 00:53:06.266
There were many happy memories.

00:53:07.685 --> 00:53:09.270
And you were so nice to me.

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:15.067
Get out of here. It's getting late.

00:53:23.701 --> 00:53:26.370
- Ung-cheol.
- Don't.

00:53:26.453 --> 00:53:28.120
- I'll take care of him.
- I got it.

00:53:28.203 --> 00:53:29.415
You should go to Gi-hyeok.

00:53:29.632 --> 00:53:31.042
- Come on.
- I'm not seeing him today.

00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:33.150
- Ung-cheol, wake up.
- Wake up.

00:53:33.335 --> 00:53:34.651
- It's time to go home.
- Get up.

00:53:34.734 --> 00:53:36.655
I better drop him off on my way home.

00:53:36.738 --> 00:53:39.383
Stand up, Ung-cheol.

00:53:39.466 --> 00:53:44.188
HIDEOUT BAR

00:53:49.768 --> 00:53:51.311
Is there anything you want?

00:53:54.606 --> 00:53:55.816
Roses?

00:53:57.092 --> 00:53:58.110
Roses?

00:53:58.369 --> 00:54:01.655
Yes. I've never gotten them before.

00:54:11.915 --> 00:54:13.125
Taxi!

00:54:19.465 --> 00:54:21.133
- I'm fine.
- Get in the car.

00:54:21.325 --> 00:54:22.676
- Oh, gosh.
- Come on.

00:54:23.644 --> 00:54:25.012
Just get in the car.

00:54:25.637 --> 00:54:27.055
- I'll take him home.
- What?

00:54:28.474 --> 00:54:29.850
Good night! Bye!

00:55:01.548 --> 00:55:03.508
Gosh, how...

00:55:03.976 --> 00:55:05.886
How did we win this?

00:55:06.428 --> 00:55:07.679
- Man.
- Well,

00:55:08.214 --> 00:55:12.017
it's not such a bad place.
You can rent DVDs too.

00:55:13.953 --> 00:55:15.980
And you can get
as much ice cream as you want.

00:55:16.064 --> 00:55:17.856
- Seriously?
- Yes.

00:55:21.235 --> 00:55:22.319
Have you been there?

00:55:23.195 --> 00:55:25.072
- Yes.
- Why?

00:55:26.365 --> 00:55:27.741
What do you mean, "Why?"

00:55:28.534 --> 00:55:30.086
What do you do at a motel?

00:55:32.955 --> 00:55:34.665
What? Are you serious?

00:55:35.107 --> 00:55:37.584
So, you've done it before?

00:55:40.337 --> 00:55:42.422
You said you've never had
a boyfriend before.

00:55:44.533 --> 00:55:46.468
You don't have to be in a relationship
to do that.

00:55:49.538 --> 00:55:51.265
I need a drink.

00:55:54.518 --> 00:55:56.061
You?

00:55:58.772 --> 00:55:59.940
Why?

00:56:00.161 --> 00:56:02.718
You think no man
would want to sleep with me?

00:56:02.801 --> 00:56:05.779
No, that's not what I mean! I mean...

00:56:07.447 --> 00:56:08.740
Let's just drink.

00:56:09.375 --> 00:56:10.534
Gosh.

00:56:13.787 --> 00:56:17.249
How come you and I have
the exact same mindset?

00:56:17.466 --> 00:56:19.042
It's the American Dream, you know?

00:56:19.451 --> 00:56:22.087
Honestly, I don't think

00:56:22.312 --> 00:56:25.048
that's a big deal.

00:56:25.131 --> 00:56:26.675
You know?

00:56:26.758 --> 00:56:29.553
There's nothing wrong with sleeping
with someone you're into.

00:56:29.661 --> 00:56:31.471
That's called being honest, right?

00:56:31.663 --> 00:56:32.806
You're right.

00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:35.559
Man. Cheers.

00:56:41.218 --> 00:56:42.566
You're a virgin, aren't you?

00:56:44.468 --> 00:56:46.695
What are you talking about?

00:56:47.137 --> 00:56:48.697
Are you out of your mind?

00:56:49.031 --> 00:56:51.031
I've been with tons of girls.

00:56:51.241 --> 00:56:54.369
- No way.
- You don't believe me?

00:56:54.812 --> 00:56:57.164
I wish I could prove it to you.

00:57:44.544 --> 00:57:45.628
Are you up?
