00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.760
I'm patronizing your business,
so could you give me a discount?

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.930
It's only 50 yuan.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.830
How dare you haggle with me?

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.990
I just want you to feel

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.010
how exhausting it is to be an artist.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.160
Why do you sound just like my mom today?

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.810
It's like you two are of one mind.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.680
I don't want to be your mother.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.810
I just think that dreams and reality

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.740
are two different things.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.200
So we must not be impulsive.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.720
We need to think carefully
before making our choice.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.560
Who was it that told me

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.440
to always hold fast to my dreams?

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.320
Why the change of attitude today?

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.760
Just the other day,
you were so excited telling me

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.850
you were going to Stanford.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.480
Why are you feeling so down today?

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.880
Stanford Medical School

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.120
is no longer an option.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.870
Why?

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.560
My exchange student spot

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.330
was taken by someone else.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.789
Stanford says

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:20.200
I can go only if I pay for myself.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.160
You are a top-performing medical student.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.270
That paper of yours

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.180
was even published in SCI.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.280
You have to believe

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.789
that you are the best.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.250
To us, fate has never been

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.780
a single-choice question.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.140
It's multiple choice.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.500
You can still choose to study abroad.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.310
Let me ask you one question.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.130
Do you truly love this field?

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.770
Of course.

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:45.009
Between love, passion and devotion,

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:45.940
what do you really feel?

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.270
What's the difference?

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.979
Loving it means
you can live with or without it.

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.310
Being passionate means

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.370
it's great to have it,
but you could live without it for a while.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.620
Being devoted means

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.570
you can't live without it
for even a minute.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.340
Then I must be...

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.420
devoted.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.550
Then what are you waiting for?

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.460
What are you doing?

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.650
If you can't go as an exchange student,

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.130
then let's send you over as
a self-funded student.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.250
This card has 50,000 yuan in it.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.090

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.500
This is all

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.410

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.140
Take it back.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.090
But I will definitely get

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.780
my spot back.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.060
The An Lan I know is back.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.710

don't you suspect Mo Yuanzhi?

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.410
Of course I do.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.670

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:02.950
You handled this case.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.740

How would I have known

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:16.330
a case as small as a lab fire

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.530
could be related to the Moma Group case?

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:20.860
Small incident?

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.660
What about Jiang Yuwen?

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:23.690
Is he alive

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:24.740
or dead?

Just follow me.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.010
The incident occurred on November 6, 2016,

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.300
after 8 PM.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.570
The lab suddenly burst into flames.

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:44.690
The fire was too intense.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.420
By the time firefighters got in,

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.550
almost everything inside was burned.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.060
There are no casualties,

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.420
and there are no bodies either.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.940
The police report said
a teacher was inside.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.200
Please confirm again.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.800
We've confirmed multiple times.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.130
The lab contains many chemicals.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.330
Once you guys wrap up your operations,

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.060
please evacuate immediately.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.660
Copy that.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.190
Everyone evacuate!

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.450
Back then, the surveillance camera
was right here.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.740
It captured the doors

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.660
clearly before and after the fire.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.570
Jiang Yuwen

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.300
entered at exactly 8:05 PM.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.420
Besides the cameras,

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:16.860
at the basement exit outside,

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.620
there were many students around.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.500
Many saw Jiang Yuwen enter,

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.980
but no one saw him leave.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.180
Among the student witnesses

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.300
was Mo Yuanzhi.

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:25.660
Half a minute later,

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.460
the sudden explosion
broke out in the laboratory.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.370
So Mo Yuanzhi

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:37.940
has a complete alibi.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.180
After that,

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.330
did you ever look for Jiang Yuwen again?

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.860
We did. We searched for a long time,

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:45.540
but couldn't find him.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.010
That's how this case became cold.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:48.340
What about You Yuxiang?

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.290
Is he connected to this case?

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.790
You Yuxiang came to make a report
after the incident.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.010
He claimed he saw

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.810
Mo Yuanzhi kill Jiang Yuwen
with his own eyes.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.030
He said there was blood everywhere,

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.830
and the weapon used was a dagger.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:01.660
But I didn't believe it.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.980
Because we couldn't find any evidence
to support it.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:04.980
No suspect, no blood,

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.440
and no body was ever found.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:08.260
So you're saying...

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.400
Mo Yuanzhi had a motive for murder, right?

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:10.910
No.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:12.890
According to investigations at that time,

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:14.370
the one who suffered
the greatest loss in the fire

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:15.420
wasn't Jiang Yuwen,

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.420
it was Mo Yuanzhi.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.860
He had a groundbreaking dataset
that was nearly complete,

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:20.980
but because of the fire,

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.580
it was all burned to nothing.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:24.510
Burned to nothing?

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.270

for questioning.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.380

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.840

trying to kill you.
