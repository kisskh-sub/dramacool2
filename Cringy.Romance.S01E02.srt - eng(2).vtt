CRINGY ROMANCE

00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:36.301
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION

00:00:36.384 --> 00:00:37.444
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO ACTUAL PERSONS, EVENTS,
OR BACKGROUNDS IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.293
Another reason we study poetry is
to understand otherness.

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:45.962
Otherness refers to the condition

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.280
of individuals who are marginalized
or excluded,

00:00:48.363 --> 00:00:51.427
and unable to act as autonomous beings.

00:00:52.094 --> 00:00:54.972
One of the key purposes
of studying poetry is

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:57.725
to explore
how its aesthetic value can express

00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:00.811
different perspectives,
alternative logic,

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:02.894
and new possibilities.

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:06.483
To better grasp
this concept of otherness...

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:08.360
- Are you into Seol-ha?
- No.

00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:11.096
- Are you into Seol-ha?
- No.

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:13.179
- Are you into Seol-ha?
- No.

00:01:15.084 --> 00:01:18.204
It's helpful to study poems
from the Japanese colonial period.

00:01:18.395 --> 00:01:20.330
- These poems vividly reflect
- So annoying.

00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:22.958
- the experience of otherness
- Why is he telling me

00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:24.167
- under colonial rule.
- that he's in love with Seol-ha?

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:27.880
- I had feelings for her first.
- There's currently a photo exhibition

00:01:27.963 --> 00:01:30.215
on 20th-century Korean poetry being held
at Daehangno Art Hall.

00:01:30.382 --> 00:01:32.217
That's it for today.

00:01:32.618 --> 00:01:35.012
- Thank you for the lecture.
- Thank you for the lecture.

00:01:42.044 --> 00:01:43.437
- Hey.
- What?

00:01:44.588 --> 00:01:46.440
- Were you sleeping?
- No.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.692
- What are you going to do?
- About what?

00:01:48.967 --> 00:01:50.318
The report about the exhibition.

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.280
- Right.
- Let's go together this Saturday.

00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:57.534
Should we?

- What are you working so hard on?
- Nothing.

00:02:26.797 --> 00:02:28.674
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

00:02:28.757 --> 00:02:31.401
- What are you hiding from us?
- Hey! Give me that!

00:02:31.777 --> 00:02:33.696
- Give it back!
- Calm down.

Give it back.

00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:46.442
Aren't you guys proud of Min-gi?

00:02:46.525 --> 00:02:48.794
We should learn his attitude from him.

00:02:49.278 --> 00:02:50.754
Was it this Saturday?

00:02:51.321 --> 00:02:52.339
Yes.

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.382
How's the preparation going?

00:02:54.783 --> 00:02:58.470
Preparation?
I don't even know what to prepare.

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:00.898
We're supposed to have dinner
after the exhibition,

00:03:00.981 --> 00:03:02.557
but I can't decide where to go.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.017
Carbonara.

00:03:04.293 --> 00:03:06.293
Girls love carbonara.

00:03:06.376 --> 00:03:08.564
Carbonara? Where is that?

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:12.617
It's not where. It's a type of spaghetti.

00:03:12.706 --> 00:03:14.527
Oh, spaghetti.

00:03:14.803 --> 00:03:15.904
Where do they sell it?

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.682
Well, they sell it at Italian restaurants,
or family restaurants.

00:03:21.765 --> 00:03:23.453
That's too expensive, man.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.338

Are you sure?

00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:51.481
I have no use for that anyway.

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:53.484
You need it, so you use it.

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:56.861
Gosh. Jun-seok.

00:03:59.122 --> 00:04:00.448
Wear these.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.909
I got you a whole outfit
that would appeal to girls.

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:07.078
Wait. No way!

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:09.249
This is...

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.900
But this is...

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:15.055

You said

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:28.499
- you've never been to Daehangno.
- Yes.

00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:32.523
Make sure you know your way around first.
Take a look.

00:04:32.631 --> 00:04:35.108
- This is Exit Two of Hyehwa Station.
- Okay.

00:04:35.211 --> 00:04:38.345
You take this exit.
Then, you'll see Marronnier Park.

00:04:38.428 --> 00:04:41.123

Oh, right. Do you sell carbonara?

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:49.177

00:07:54.392 --> 00:07:56.392
It's really fun. Come and check it out.

- Come to our play.
- You should watch our play.

00:07:58.921 --> 00:08:00.650

- Our play is funnier.

You're dressed differently than usual.

00:09:01.833 --> 00:09:04.252
Am I?

00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:06.421
Let's get going.

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:07.922
Sure.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:18.850
Welcome.

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:34.365
That will be 6 dollars and 30 cents.

00:09:42.649 --> 00:09:45.251
I'm sorry. We're out of coins.
Give me a second.

00:09:53.159 --> 00:09:56.012
Ma'am? Your change!

00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:01.642
Hello.

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:14.614
What's wrong?

00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:16.240
What is it?

00:10:17.434 --> 00:10:18.368
Hey.

00:10:18.518 --> 00:10:20.518
Did you see a girl in a pink skirt
on your way here?

00:10:20.603 --> 00:10:21.913
She had long hair.

00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:23.915
Why? Is she pretty?

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.708
It's not like that.

00:10:25.984 --> 00:10:27.752
She was a customer,
but she forgot something.

00:10:28.278 --> 00:10:29.880
Did Min-gi call you yet?

00:10:30.013 --> 00:10:33.299
- Not yet.
- I wonder if he's doing all right.

00:10:33.758 --> 00:10:36.302
I'm sure he is.
We've given him enough help.

00:10:36.453 --> 00:10:38.680
He must be having dinner by now.

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:41.015
- I'm starving. Let's go.
- Do you have any expired food?

00:10:41.098 --> 00:10:42.767
Let's go inside.

00:10:45.612 --> 00:10:47.939

Oh, man.

00:10:51.526 --> 00:10:53.361
Look at the time.

00:10:53.636 --> 00:10:55.446
I'm hungry.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.808
- So am I.
- Do you happen to like carbonara?

00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:00.544
- Carbonara?
- Yes.

00:11:00.727 --> 00:11:02.620
I love it!

00:11:02.937 --> 00:11:04.147
- Really?
- Yes.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.957
I never knew you liked carbonara.

00:11:06.107 --> 00:11:08.459
Let's go and eat carbonara.

00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:09.877
Sure.

00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:30.773
I don't see carbonara spaghetti.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.444
It's on the pasta page.

00:11:35.812 --> 00:11:37.864
CARBONARA PASTA

00:11:41.017 --> 00:11:44.329
Carbonara spaghetti...

00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:48.249
- Would you like it in spaghetti noodles?
- Pardon?

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:51.920
Carbonara is usually
made with fettuccine noodles.

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:55.046
Right. It is.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:58.009
Okay. I'll take that.

00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:01.054
You even change the noodles?

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:02.805
That's detailed.

00:12:03.289 --> 00:12:04.432
It's nothing.

00:12:06.809 --> 00:12:08.060
What else should we get?

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.359
Back ribs sound nice.

00:12:19.697 --> 00:12:21.324
Did you lose something?

00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:25.286
That's weird.

00:12:25.962 --> 00:12:28.706
I was sure I put it
in the pocket of my jacket.

00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:32.126
What else do you want, Min-gi?

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:42.137
Hey, Min-gi!

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:45.806
Hey.

00:12:49.377 --> 00:12:50.853
What do you want?

00:12:51.212 --> 00:12:52.814
I want cola.

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:55.066
Cola?

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:56.860
What about food?

00:12:57.176 --> 00:12:58.527
Oh, I...

00:12:59.053 --> 00:13:01.364
I feel a bit sick to my stomach.

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:02.824
Do you have a stomachache?

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:06.870
I think so. Let me run to the restroom.

00:13:07.562 --> 00:13:08.663
Min-gi.

00:13:49.448 --> 00:13:50.974
Shoot.

00:13:57.737 --> 00:13:59.130
Our food is here.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:00.756
Hurry back.

00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:03.259
Oh, crap.

00:14:31.237 --> 00:14:33.956
ONE DOLLAR

00:14:51.682 --> 00:14:54.477
What took you so long?
Are you feeling nauseous?

00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:56.896
No, I'm fine now. The food will get cold.

00:14:56.979 --> 00:14:58.979
- Eat up.
- Eat with me.

00:15:00.633 --> 00:15:01.901
I can't finish it all.

00:15:02.693 --> 00:15:05.321
No, I actually have an upset stomach.
You should eat.

00:15:18.651 --> 00:15:21.212
I need to use the restroom again.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.270
"I only drank cola,
so I'll only pay for that."

00:15:38.171 --> 00:15:40.023
No.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.363
One, two.

00:15:47.664 --> 00:15:49.664
"This is for the cola I had."

00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:55.538
Yes, that sounds natural enough.

00:15:55.897 --> 00:15:57.790
It's not like I told her I'd treat her.

00:15:59.984 --> 00:16:02.712
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Come again.

00:16:04.438 --> 00:16:06.006
Are you okay?

00:16:06.324 --> 00:16:07.892
Yes. What did you do?

00:16:08.201 --> 00:16:09.677
Let's go. I already paid for the food.

00:16:10.086 --> 00:16:13.556
No, I should pay for my drink.

00:16:13.998 --> 00:16:15.850
This is for the cola I ordered.

00:16:17.727 --> 00:16:19.437
No, it's not even that much.

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:20.771
No.

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:23.130
This is wrong. I drank it.

00:16:23.213 --> 00:16:24.400
Keep it.

00:16:29.889 --> 00:16:30.907
Let's go.

00:16:37.271 --> 00:16:38.581
No.

00:16:40.082 --> 00:16:41.667
This is so wrong.

00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:46.381
Min-gi.

00:16:47.215 --> 00:16:48.591
Why did you do that?

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:52.052
Give him a break.
He's more upset than we are.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.683
Why did you give her the four dollars?

00:16:57.934 --> 00:16:59.519
What was I supposed to do, then?

00:17:00.253 --> 00:17:02.253
I should at least pay for my drink!

00:17:02.455 --> 00:17:04.257
I had to give her the four dollars!

00:17:04.341 --> 00:17:06.150
Yes, that's only fair.

00:17:07.568 --> 00:17:08.652
Gosh.

00:17:09.237 --> 00:17:11.030
Where should I begin?

00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:14.365
Idiot.

00:17:14.575 --> 00:17:16.535
When that happens, you tell her,

00:17:16.618 --> 00:17:18.754
"You paid for it this time,
so it's on me next time."

00:17:18.837 --> 00:17:19.914
How cool is that?

00:17:20.982 --> 00:17:22.417
You made yourself look pathetic.

00:17:47.467 --> 00:17:49.467
Min-gi fumbled the ball,

00:17:50.386 --> 00:17:52.822
and Jae-seon earned a point
without even doing anything.

00:17:56.793 --> 00:17:58.661
That loser.

00:18:46.551 --> 00:18:49.003
You forgot your change last time.

00:18:49.512 --> 00:18:51.322
Your change was 3.70 dollars,

00:18:51.405 --> 00:18:53.405
and this is 1.80 dollars,
so here's 1.90 dollars.

00:18:57.411 --> 00:18:58.595
I see.

00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:52.692
Hello?

00:19:53.943 --> 00:19:55.445
It's me. Open the gate for me.

00:19:56.153 --> 00:19:57.571
I'm right outside.

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:02.117
Are you allowed to be outside
at this hour?

00:20:02.518 --> 00:20:04.603
I snuck out while Dad was asleep.

00:20:04.763 --> 00:20:06.086
Gyu-cheol came to Seoul.

00:20:07.623 --> 00:20:09.500
Anyway, open this gate.

00:20:09.583 --> 00:20:11.126
I forgot my keys.

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.753
Shoot.

00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:14.714
All right.

00:20:50.791 --> 00:20:52.042
Man.

00:20:57.406 --> 00:20:58.674
What was that?

00:20:59.236 --> 00:21:00.592
What?

00:21:02.495 --> 00:21:03.638
Who's there?

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:13.314
Guess who!

00:21:13.564 --> 00:21:14.815
What?

00:21:14.898 --> 00:21:16.776
Guess who it is!

00:21:17.818 --> 00:21:19.695
- Is that you, Jun-seok?
- Jung-seok?

00:21:19.778 --> 00:21:21.778
No, I'm not Jung-seok!

00:21:21.989 --> 00:21:24.450
Let me go! What do you think you're doing?

00:21:30.664 --> 00:21:32.040
Sorry, sir.

00:21:33.918 --> 00:21:35.420
Have you lost your mind?

00:21:35.503 --> 00:21:38.348
I'm truly sorry.

00:21:42.101 --> 00:21:43.803
Am I still dreaming?

00:21:44.887 --> 00:21:46.013
How bizarre.

00:21:47.164 --> 00:21:48.807
Right. My radish water kimchi.

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:02.090
From the convenience store...

00:23:13.401 --> 00:23:14.644
Sorry about that.

00:23:52.448 --> 00:23:53.766
Here.

00:23:53.941 --> 00:23:55.434
Thanks!

00:23:59.922 --> 00:24:01.232
Just a second.

00:24:02.483 --> 00:24:03.985
How much was this?

00:24:05.194 --> 00:24:08.322
Come on. Don't do that.

00:24:08.405 --> 00:24:11.617
I thought you liked keeping things exact
when it came to money.

00:24:12.743 --> 00:24:14.370
Here. Twenty cents.

00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:19.166
You're really...

00:24:21.001 --> 00:24:22.753
You're being really mean.

00:24:24.088 --> 00:24:28.926
I went to Daehangno early in the morning
and prepared everything

00:24:29.593 --> 00:24:31.136
so that I could have fun with you.

00:24:35.958 --> 00:24:37.768
Min-gi, are you crying?

00:24:38.435 --> 00:24:40.435
- Are you crying?
- No, I'm not!

00:24:40.729 --> 00:24:43.132
- I was joking!
- What...

00:24:43.216 --> 00:24:44.901
Do you think I'm a child? I'm not crying.

00:24:46.619 --> 00:24:49.947
The brilliance of the sunlight
brings tears to my eyes.

00:24:50.806 --> 00:24:54.076
Realizing I'm alive brings
tears to my eyes.

00:24:54.243 --> 00:24:55.244
Min-gi.

00:24:55.517 --> 00:24:56.746
Let's go and eat.

00:24:57.146 --> 00:24:59.957
That was from Again, Spring Returns
by Do Jong-hwan.

00:25:00.791 --> 00:25:02.631
The spring may be bright and beautiful,

00:25:02.715 --> 00:25:05.713
but it's sadder
as it only lasts for a short time.

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:07.965
Students of Hongin University,

00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:11.177
close your books and come outside.

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:14.596
Why don't you feel
the brilliance of spring for a moment?

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:16.348
Come on.

00:25:16.473 --> 00:25:17.933
Because the spring of our lifetime is

00:25:18.709 --> 00:25:20.060
right now.

00:25:21.603 --> 00:25:22.813
Here's the first song.

00:25:23.022 --> 00:25:25.691
'Chau Chau' by Deli Spice.

00:25:34.491 --> 00:25:39.070
I can hear

00:25:39.212 --> 00:25:42.083
Your voice

00:25:42.739 --> 00:25:49.505
I can hear your voice

00:25:49.589 --> 00:25:50.882
Everyone!

00:25:51.033 --> 00:25:55.637
- I can hear
- I can hear

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.640
- Your voice
- Your voice

00:25:59.166 --> 00:26:03.479
- I can hear
- I can hear

00:26:03.562 --> 00:26:05.952
- Your voice
- Your voice

00:26:06.036 --> 00:26:07.524
Do you know this song?

00:26:07.841 --> 00:26:08.943
No.

00:26:09.026 --> 00:26:10.945
What? I thought you knew.

00:26:11.028 --> 00:26:13.697
It's one of my favorite bands.
They're called Deli Spice.

00:26:13.931 --> 00:26:16.075
That's the name of a band?

00:26:16.308 --> 00:26:17.910
Yes. An indie band.

00:26:18.227 --> 00:26:19.870
Indie band?

00:26:20.312 --> 00:26:23.081
It's one of those things
only a few people know about.

00:26:23.507 --> 00:26:24.625
I see.

00:26:24.708 --> 00:26:29.338
I can hear

00:26:29.505 --> 00:26:32.091
Your voice

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.369
- I can hear
- I can hear

00:26:35.452 --> 00:26:40.307
Your voice

00:26:41.225 --> 00:26:45.896
I can hear

00:26:45.979 --> 00:26:47.856
Your voice

00:26:47.939 --> 00:26:49.524
Hi, Geon.

00:26:50.592 --> 00:26:52.891
- You know this song?
- Know it?

00:26:52.974 --> 00:26:54.822
I'm a huge fan of Deli Spice's.

00:26:54.905 --> 00:26:56.031
Really?

00:26:56.198 --> 00:26:57.783
Do you also like Deli Spice?

00:26:58.017 --> 00:26:59.910
One of the members is Jun-ho,

00:27:00.185 --> 00:27:01.703
and we used to be like brothers.

00:27:03.063 --> 00:27:07.000
Do you mean Yun Jun-ho, the bassist?

00:27:07.209 --> 00:27:08.919
- Do you mean it?
- Wait.

00:27:09.028 --> 00:27:11.028
- I'll call him now.
- No!

00:27:11.839 --> 00:27:13.215
My heart will burst.

00:27:16.744 --> 00:27:17.720
Oh, right.

00:27:17.886 --> 00:27:20.138
I heard that Deli Spice was performing
on Saturday.

00:27:20.347 --> 00:27:21.974
- Do you want to come with me?
- Yes!

00:27:23.225 --> 00:27:25.061
- Yes.
- But

00:27:25.144 --> 00:27:26.704
it will be the front row
where the staff is.

00:27:26.787 --> 00:27:28.814
It's right in front of the speakers,
so it may be too loud.

00:27:29.006 --> 00:27:30.566
The staff zone?

00:27:31.024 --> 00:27:34.152
I love those zones!

00:27:35.113 --> 00:27:37.233
But you'll have to come
to the after-party.

00:27:37.316 --> 00:27:38.410
Are you okay with that?

00:27:38.574 --> 00:27:40.659
We never let people go home once we start.

00:27:40.934 --> 00:27:43.995
I love not going home.

00:27:46.565 --> 00:27:48.834
But are you sure I can join you?

00:27:49.251 --> 00:27:51.336
Of course. I'm sure they'll be glad.

00:27:52.004 --> 00:27:53.172
You're a new face.

00:27:53.722 --> 00:27:56.466
There's no way. I can't believe it.

00:27:57.885 --> 00:28:00.346
Right. Can I bring one more person?

00:28:00.762 --> 00:28:01.846
Him.

00:28:04.692 --> 00:28:08.187
Oh, no. I'm fine. Don't mind me.

00:28:11.106 --> 00:28:12.232
His words.

00:28:12.591 --> 00:28:15.360
Anyway, thank you.

00:28:21.016 --> 00:28:24.202
You celebrated your 300th day.
Now, it's your anniversary?

00:28:24.995 --> 00:28:27.665
The first anniversary is
always the most important.

00:28:27.748 --> 00:28:30.751
How do you celebrate every anniversary?

00:28:31.501 --> 00:28:33.920
That's why you don't have a girlfriend.

00:28:34.296 --> 00:28:36.048
No, you're making a big deal out of it.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.092
Whatever. Are you done yet?

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:40.761
I'm done.

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.725
Oh, it looks good!

00:28:47.251 --> 00:28:49.311
This will look perfect on Gyu-cheol.
Pick this one.

00:28:49.586 --> 00:28:51.279
Okay. That one's good.

00:28:51.588 --> 00:28:52.856
Try this on too.

00:28:55.192 --> 00:28:56.110
Again?

00:28:57.110 --> 00:29:00.447
Just get this one. It'll look good on him.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:02.866
Do you want the barbecue or not?

00:29:07.079 --> 00:29:08.289
Give it.

00:29:10.165 --> 00:29:11.333
Make it quick.

00:29:20.217 --> 00:29:21.535
- Nice.
- Oh, my gosh.

00:29:21.618 --> 00:29:23.136
It looks perfect.

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:26.305
Your boyfriend is tall
and has broad shoulders,

00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:28.389
so everything he puts on looks amazing.

00:29:28.472 --> 00:29:31.270
- He's not my boyfriend.
- He's not?

00:29:32.154 --> 00:29:34.773
This is amazing. You should get this one.

00:29:35.107 --> 00:29:36.233
It's perfect.

00:29:43.323 --> 00:29:44.491
Again?

00:29:53.008 --> 00:29:55.585
The meat is enough for me.
You didn't have to get me this.

00:29:56.795 --> 00:29:58.795
It's an early birthday gift.

00:29:59.131 --> 00:30:00.341
Your birthday is coming up soon.

00:30:00.824 --> 00:30:02.759
You remembered. Thanks.

00:30:03.695 --> 00:30:04.837
Of course, I did.

00:30:04.928 --> 00:30:08.015
You introduced Gyu-cheol to me
at your last birthday party.

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:11.226
- Oh, I did.
- Yes.

00:30:11.935 --> 00:30:13.770
So, my birthday is your anniversary.

00:30:13.854 --> 00:30:14.938
Yes.

00:30:15.239 --> 00:30:17.524
Should we go out for a drink
with Gyu-cheol on my birthday?

00:30:18.567 --> 00:30:20.944
Why would we drink with you
on our anniversary?

00:30:23.322 --> 00:30:25.491
Gyu-cheol and I are going
to a guesthouse that day.

00:30:26.458 --> 00:30:27.576
A guesthouse?

00:30:28.035 --> 00:30:29.828
- You're going to sleep out?
- Yes.

00:30:30.328 --> 00:30:31.705
Did your dad give you permission?

00:30:31.788 --> 00:30:33.999
Are you insane?
He'll kill me if I get caught.

00:30:34.316 --> 00:30:36.316
He's going on a business trip
to Busan that day.

00:30:37.544 --> 00:30:42.883
I've never gone on an overnight trip
with a guy before.

00:30:43.467 --> 00:30:46.053
I'm so nervous.
It's driving me crazy already.

00:30:47.304 --> 00:30:48.722
I'm sorry to break it to you.

00:30:49.014 --> 00:30:51.014
- What?
- I know about it now.

00:30:52.125 --> 00:30:53.601
I know.

00:30:54.102 --> 00:30:56.730
So, eat this meat
and keep your mouth shut.

00:30:56.813 --> 00:30:59.691
Pork isn't enough to keep my mouth shut.
You should at least

00:30:59.925 --> 00:31:01.925
- buy me beef.
- You know what?

00:31:02.008 --> 00:31:02.864
- Take that off.
- What?

00:31:02.947 --> 00:31:04.571
- You don't deserve this shirt.
- Fine.

00:31:04.654 --> 00:31:06.906
I'm sorry. This tastes great.

00:31:08.909 --> 00:31:10.327
Any plans for your birthday?

00:31:11.061 --> 00:31:12.371
My birthday?

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.102
I don't know.

00:31:15.065 --> 00:31:16.625
I'll probably drink with the guys.

00:31:18.452 --> 00:31:20.670
What about your dad? Isn't he coming?

00:31:20.796 --> 00:31:21.811
My dad?

00:31:22.631 --> 00:31:23.924
I'm not sure.

00:31:24.508 --> 00:31:25.926
I doubt he even remembers my birthday.

00:31:27.928 --> 00:31:29.805
But he came by last year.

00:31:32.582 --> 00:31:35.518
Right. That was for my cousin's wedding.

00:31:39.189 --> 00:31:42.067
- Can we order one more serving?
- Sure.

00:31:42.442 --> 00:31:44.811
Ma'am, one more serving, please.

00:31:44.895 --> 00:31:47.197
- We'll also have a doenjang stew.
- Okay.

00:31:49.057 --> 00:31:51.451
- This is so delicious.
- Should we drink some soju?

00:31:51.952 --> 00:31:54.913
Of course. A bottle of soju, please!

00:31:57.332 --> 00:31:59.459
- Gosh.
- Come on.

00:31:59.793 --> 00:32:01.003
That's silly.

00:32:01.086 --> 00:32:02.170
Hey!

00:32:02.529 --> 00:32:04.256
- What's up?
- Where are you headed?

00:32:05.449 --> 00:32:07.301
Oh, hey.

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:12.138
Hey, get in!

00:32:13.123 --> 00:32:14.558
I'll see you later.

00:32:15.308 --> 00:32:16.434
What?

00:32:20.499 --> 00:32:21.899
Hi.

00:32:26.461 --> 00:32:27.571
What's going on?

00:32:28.055 --> 00:32:29.490
Why is Min-gi getting in his car?

00:32:32.242 --> 00:32:34.242
Are they two close friends?

00:32:34.778 --> 00:32:37.973
WELCOME, AND CONGRATULATIONS
TO ALL INCOMING FRESHMEN

00:32:43.278 --> 00:32:45.547
That's his routine.

00:32:46.531 --> 00:32:48.258
His routine?

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:50.528
You know, taking girls to concerts
using his connections

00:32:50.611 --> 00:32:52.095
and taking them to after-parties.

00:32:53.573 --> 00:32:55.573
So lame.

00:32:55.899 --> 00:32:58.351
That's really lame.

00:32:58.794 --> 00:33:00.646
He said something
about not letting her go home, didn't he?

00:33:01.755 --> 00:33:03.523
Yes, he did.

00:33:04.716 --> 00:33:06.568
Crap.

00:33:06.651 --> 00:33:08.028
Why?

00:33:12.499 --> 00:33:14.618
- What do you think that means?
- Pardon?

00:33:20.624 --> 00:33:23.360
No way. It can't be!

00:33:23.443 --> 00:33:25.421
He's done that so many times before.

00:33:25.504 --> 00:33:27.840
- Do you think this is his first time?
- That jerk!

00:33:28.548 --> 00:33:30.909
I mean, you can't do that.

00:33:30.992 --> 00:33:32.761
That's taking advantage of her.

00:33:32.844 --> 00:33:34.512
That's what he does!

00:33:37.057 --> 00:33:38.809
Oh, gosh.

00:33:39.935 --> 00:33:42.563
What can we do to stop him?

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:47.525
It's a bit strange, though.

00:33:48.401 --> 00:33:49.527
What is?

00:33:52.822 --> 00:33:54.449
Why are you so enthusiastic?

00:34:00.163 --> 00:34:01.956
Don't tell me you're...

00:34:14.786 --> 00:34:15.845
Are you type A as well?

00:34:16.596 --> 00:34:17.639
Sorry?

00:34:18.723 --> 00:34:21.752
Oh, yes. My blood type.

00:34:21.835 --> 00:34:23.336
I knew it.

00:34:24.171 --> 00:34:26.171
I'm type A too, dude.

00:34:28.133 --> 00:34:30.610
I thought so. Type-A people

00:34:30.693 --> 00:34:32.846
- can be considerate
- Yes.

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:34.489
and have a strong sense of responsibility.

00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:39.661
Anyway,
thanks for calling me right away.

00:34:40.287 --> 00:34:42.287
I'm not the type to forget this gesture.

00:34:42.497 --> 00:34:46.251
Sure. Anyway, what's your plan?

00:34:51.281 --> 00:34:54.926
When I was a freshman,
there was Min-a in my department.

00:34:55.202 --> 00:34:57.888
Min-a, I'm so glad to see you.

00:34:58.872 --> 00:35:00.807
I didn't sleep a wink last night.

00:35:01.391 --> 00:35:03.391
I was so tired

00:35:03.475 --> 00:35:05.249
that I couldn't even sleep.

00:35:05.333 --> 00:35:08.315
I started feeling sleepy
when the sun rose in the morning.

00:35:08.548 --> 00:35:10.275
Why wasn't I able to fall asleep?

00:35:12.385 --> 00:35:14.385
So, did you go out with her?

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:19.910
No. It wasn't exactly official.

00:35:20.268 --> 00:35:22.996
But it was something like that.

00:35:29.753 --> 00:35:31.922
One day...

00:35:32.839 --> 00:35:35.634
- What's that bag for?
- This? It's nothing.

00:35:35.717 --> 00:35:37.077
I've been practicing playing the guitar.

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:38.803
- Practice?
- Yes.

00:35:38.886 --> 00:35:41.181
I'm preparing for a performance.
Do you want to come?

00:35:41.264 --> 00:35:42.933
- You're performing?
- Yes.

00:35:43.124 --> 00:35:45.101
- Are you sure I can come?
- Of course.

00:35:45.184 --> 00:35:46.853
- You got something on you.
- What?

00:35:46.936 --> 00:35:48.312
- I'll get that for you.
- Thanks.

00:35:50.407 --> 00:35:52.943
Jae-seon!

00:35:53.218 --> 00:35:55.529
Geon invited me to his show.

00:35:55.979 --> 00:35:57.030
Come with me.

00:35:58.848 --> 00:36:00.032
No, I'm fine.

00:36:00.533 --> 00:36:01.701
Have fun.

00:36:04.329 --> 00:36:05.622
That was a mistake.

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:08.500
I shouldn't have sent her alone.

00:36:10.418 --> 00:36:13.630
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:36:18.118 --> 00:36:19.928
That tastes good.

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:21.972
- Your guitar skills have gotten better.
- I practiced so hard.

00:36:22.055 --> 00:36:23.965
- So did I.
- It was a great show.

00:36:24.049 --> 00:36:25.850
- You did great.
- We all did.

00:36:25.975 --> 00:36:27.226
That tastes good.

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:31.910
Thanks.

00:36:33.909 --> 00:36:36.161
- Hey, Min-a is drunk.
- Oh, my gosh.

00:36:37.929 --> 00:36:39.280
That's fine.

00:36:39.406 --> 00:36:40.699
What's wrong with me?

00:36:40.865 --> 00:36:41.908
Cheers.

00:36:41.991 --> 00:36:44.493
You guys need to take it up a notch.

00:36:44.769 --> 00:36:46.245
Love shot!

00:36:46.328 --> 00:36:47.730
- Love shot!
- Love shot!

00:36:47.813 --> 00:36:49.066
- Love shot!
- Seriously.

00:36:49.149 --> 00:36:50.542
- We're not like that, guys.
- Love shot!

00:36:50.625 --> 00:36:51.823
- That's why you're doing it.
- We're not dating.

00:36:51.907 --> 00:36:54.012
How long are you going to keep
making my shoulders dance?

00:36:54.095 --> 00:36:56.365
Look at my shoulders! They're dislocated!

00:36:56.530 --> 00:36:58.799
- Dislocated!
- Dislocated!

00:37:04.514 --> 00:37:05.515
Hey.

00:37:05.765 --> 00:37:07.934
You guys need to practice harder.

00:37:52.937 --> 00:37:54.480
You know what really pisses me off?

00:37:55.482 --> 00:37:57.984
Min-a must have had real feelings
for Geon.

00:37:58.067 --> 00:38:00.612
But he didn't.
He was just toying with her.

00:38:02.655 --> 00:38:04.407
Stupid girl.

00:38:06.576 --> 00:38:10.747
So, was it over between you and her?

00:38:11.998 --> 00:38:13.750
Who? Min-a?

00:38:16.669 --> 00:38:18.921
There was nothing to end.

00:38:19.004 --> 00:38:21.004
It wasn't like we were
officially in a relationship.

00:38:22.383 --> 00:38:24.594
We're just friends now.

00:38:26.763 --> 00:38:28.098
Anyway,

00:38:29.015 --> 00:38:31.976
about Geon,
I won't let it slide this time.

00:38:36.481 --> 00:38:38.091
She must have had real feelings for Geon.

00:38:38.174 --> 00:38:40.693
But he didn't.
He was just toying with her.

00:38:46.032 --> 00:38:47.350
- Hey!
- You scared me!

00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:53.665
Is something wrong?
What's got you looking so serious?

00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:55.790
It's nothing.

00:38:56.376 --> 00:38:59.129
You're going to the show
on Saturday, right?

00:38:59.304 --> 00:39:01.304
I can't wait.

00:39:03.074 --> 00:39:05.885
- They say it'll rain on Saturday.
- Seriously?

00:39:06.661 --> 00:39:09.514
That's awesome. I love it when it rains.

00:39:10.515 --> 00:39:11.641
You like rain.

00:39:14.185 --> 00:39:16.185
Can I ask you something?

00:39:16.813 --> 00:39:17.856
What?

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:21.968
I know a girl from a different major.

00:39:22.635 --> 00:39:24.638
- A girlfriend?
- No.

00:39:24.721 --> 00:39:26.865
We're just friends.

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.993
- And?
- Anyway,

00:39:30.076 --> 00:39:32.312
I guess one of the seniors offered
to help with an assignment

00:39:32.395 --> 00:39:34.038
and asked her to drink with him afterward.

00:39:35.148 --> 00:39:37.148
Drinking is nice.

00:39:37.333 --> 00:39:41.112
No, but he's the kind of guy
you shouldn't trust.

00:39:41.296 --> 00:39:43.840
He only offers to help the female juniors

00:39:43.923 --> 00:39:45.466
and make them drink after.

00:39:45.742 --> 00:39:46.968
That's what he does.

00:39:48.286 --> 00:39:49.971
How do you know him so well?

00:39:53.416 --> 00:39:56.352
A friend of mine from high school is
in that major.

00:39:58.938 --> 00:40:03.109
So, I'm not sure
if I should tell her or not.

00:40:03.192 --> 00:40:05.444
- You're not going to, are you?
- What?

00:40:06.362 --> 00:40:07.863
That's a bit lame.

00:40:08.489 --> 00:40:10.575
Badmouthing other people

00:40:10.658 --> 00:40:12.368
about the strange rumors you heard.

00:40:13.019 --> 00:40:14.162
Of course not.

00:40:15.121 --> 00:40:17.915
Why would I ever tell her that?

00:40:21.669 --> 00:40:25.256
The weather is fantastic today. Isn't it?

00:40:27.258 --> 00:40:28.426
It is.

00:40:46.361 --> 00:40:48.655
Deli Spice.

00:41:09.684 --> 00:41:14.347
I can hear

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:17.433
Your voice

00:41:21.629 --> 00:41:24.481
NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY TO BLOCK IT OUT,
I CAN HEAR YOUR VOICE

00:41:24.565 --> 00:41:26.992
NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY TO SHUT IT DOWN,
I CAN HEAR YOUR VOICE

00:41:34.058 --> 00:41:35.951
So, she likes this type of music.

00:41:44.093 --> 00:41:46.378
The noodles will get soggy. Hurry and eat.

00:41:46.671 --> 00:41:49.591
Leave him be. He's doing what he can.

00:41:50.199 --> 00:41:52.051
He even has to memorize the lyrics?

00:41:52.969 --> 00:41:54.804
I guess that's his way.

00:41:59.818 --> 00:42:01.269
"Dee-lie-spee-chay?"

00:42:02.103 --> 00:42:03.313
"Deli-spissy."

00:42:04.397 --> 00:42:05.815
"Deli-spissy."

00:42:23.708 --> 00:42:25.585
- Getting here wasn't easy, was it?
- Not really.

00:42:26.044 --> 00:42:27.295
Have you been here before?

00:42:28.488 --> 00:42:30.090
I don't think I have.

00:42:30.406 --> 00:42:31.966
I'm sure you'll love it.

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:33.510
What's great about this--

00:42:33.893 --> 00:42:35.261
Jae-seon?

00:42:46.297 --> 00:42:48.024
Are you planning on using violence?

00:42:48.416 --> 00:42:49.442
No.

00:42:49.968 --> 00:42:52.570
- I have a plan.
- Min-gi, you're here!

00:42:52.945 --> 00:42:54.945
I don't know what your plan is,
but I can't wait to find out.

00:42:55.556 --> 00:42:56.740
What are you guys doing here?

00:42:57.417 --> 00:42:59.494
- We're here for the show.
- Jeez.

00:42:59.852 --> 00:43:02.079
You're here to watch the show?
Don't be ridiculous.

00:43:02.522 --> 00:43:04.249
Do you even know who's performing tonight?

00:43:04.332 --> 00:43:06.918
- Deli Spice--
- Stay out of this.

00:43:11.714 --> 00:43:13.299
You don't like this stuff.

00:43:13.825 --> 00:43:16.970
Just go home and watch a pop music show.

00:43:17.412 --> 00:43:18.430
You're wrong.

00:43:18.788 --> 00:43:21.182
I love Deli Spice.

00:43:21.641 --> 00:43:25.019
Do you now? Name one song by the band.

00:43:25.128 --> 00:43:26.771
- Mask, Chau Chau--
- You.

00:43:27.088 --> 00:43:29.065
I told you to shut your mouth.

00:43:33.011 --> 00:43:35.613
Still clinging
to that petty sense of pride, I see.

00:43:36.572 --> 00:43:39.700
Makes sense. That's the best
you can brag about, isn't it?

00:43:43.454 --> 00:43:44.705
Are you out of your mind?

00:43:45.273 --> 00:43:46.666
You want to punch me?

00:43:47.608 --> 00:43:49.084
Come on, guys.

00:43:49.919 --> 00:43:51.170
Nothing.

00:43:53.364 --> 00:43:56.342
We're going to enjoy the show
by ourselves, so don't mind us.

00:43:57.894 --> 00:43:59.553
It's about time she came.

00:43:59.637 --> 00:44:01.222
Is someone else coming?

00:44:02.498 --> 00:44:03.641
Hey, Min-a!

00:44:09.188 --> 00:44:10.773
You jerk.

00:44:14.994 --> 00:44:16.404
Shoot.

00:44:22.994 --> 00:44:24.994
- Have a word with me.
- Why?

00:44:25.855 --> 00:44:27.373
Isn't it nice to see Min-a
after all this time?

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:28.541
Say hi.

00:44:29.192 --> 00:44:30.460
Follow me.

00:44:31.903 --> 00:44:33.421
Give me a minute.

00:44:35.198 --> 00:44:37.008
Min-gi, that's Min-a. Get acquainted.

00:44:37.341 --> 00:44:38.467
What...

00:44:45.208 --> 00:44:46.643
You bastard.

00:44:47.143 --> 00:44:48.936
- Do you call yourself human?
- What about you?

00:44:49.312 --> 00:44:50.480
You think you're human?

00:44:50.963 --> 00:44:53.148
Do the same thing to Seol-ha
right in front of Min-a.

00:44:53.883 --> 00:44:55.193
Are you serious?

00:44:57.144 --> 00:44:58.154
Hey.

00:44:58.487 --> 00:45:01.156
Get out of here if you don't want
to embarrass yourself in front of Seol-ha.

00:45:12.001 --> 00:45:13.377
Douchebag.

00:45:14.879 --> 00:45:17.882
Oh, you went to our college.

00:45:18.699 --> 00:45:20.435
Then, why did you transfer
to another school?

00:45:20.518 --> 00:45:23.346
- Well, that's--
- Hey, Seol-ha.

00:45:23.621 --> 00:45:25.765
You know, it's...

00:45:26.224 --> 00:45:27.350
Sorry.

00:45:28.142 --> 00:45:29.477
Did you wait long?

00:45:30.086 --> 00:45:31.938
- Where's Geon?
- Right.

00:45:32.505 --> 00:45:34.190
Something urgent came up at home.

00:45:34.882 --> 00:45:36.233
He asked me to tell you he's sorry.

00:45:36.492 --> 00:45:39.111
- So, he just left?
- I guess it's really urgent.

00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:40.946
Why did you ask me to come?

00:45:41.405 --> 00:45:42.865
Oh, right. I forgot.

00:45:43.324 --> 00:45:45.435
Say hi. This is Seo Min-gi.
He's a junior at school.

00:45:45.518 --> 00:45:46.911
We introduced ourselves earlier.

00:45:47.078 --> 00:45:49.289
- Right.
- Why did you ask me to come here?

00:45:51.958 --> 00:45:53.844
I wanted to introduce him to you!

00:45:53.928 --> 00:45:55.545
- What?
- What do you think about him?

00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:58.631
He's a junior who really looks up to me.

00:45:58.739 --> 00:46:02.092
I've been keeping an eye on him,
and he turned out to be a great guy.

00:46:02.285 --> 00:46:04.120
He's also type A, so he's responsible--

00:46:04.204 --> 00:46:05.430
- Hey.
- Yes?

00:46:06.681 --> 00:46:09.601
Do you think I came all this far
to be set up with this joke?

00:46:12.144 --> 00:46:14.605
Min-a, what's wrong?

00:46:15.548 --> 00:46:17.108
You're really mean to me.

00:46:21.345 --> 00:46:22.738
Min-a!

00:46:24.649 --> 00:46:26.993
Shoot. Watch the show without me.

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:29.787
Min-a!

00:46:30.062 --> 00:46:31.080
Wait!

00:46:34.083 --> 00:46:35.585
They're in love with each other.

00:46:36.043 --> 00:46:37.044
What?

00:46:37.528 --> 00:46:39.130
How do you know that?

00:46:39.363 --> 00:46:40.798
It's obvious.

00:46:41.674 --> 00:46:42.758
This is great.

00:46:43.217 --> 00:46:44.760
- Let's head in.
- What?

00:46:45.203 --> 00:46:46.554
Okay.

00:46:54.278 --> 00:46:55.521
Hurry!

00:47:01.652 --> 00:47:03.279
You've never been to a place like this,
right?

00:47:26.177 --> 00:47:27.929
Never let go of my hand!

00:48:43.121 --> 00:48:45.006
Wait, it's Bicycle Ride!

00:48:46.532 --> 00:48:48.509
How did you know it was that song?

00:48:48.768 --> 00:48:49.844
What?

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:53.222
How did you recognize this song?

00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:57.977
I also bought their CD!

00:48:58.544 --> 00:48:59.862
Seriously?

00:48:59.946 --> 00:49:02.106
- Yes!
- You're the best!

00:49:13.868 --> 00:49:18.006
Somehow wakes me up

00:49:18.289 --> 00:49:20.541
Instead of wearing me down

00:49:20.625 --> 00:49:23.804
The same old alley I passed by

00:49:23.888 --> 00:49:25.888
Every day

00:49:26.697 --> 00:49:31.510
When I'm with you, strangely

00:49:31.827 --> 00:49:35.597
It feels brand new

00:49:35.790 --> 00:49:38.876
Slender shoulders, tearful eyes

00:49:39.101 --> 00:49:42.647
Yes, I can forget everything for you

00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:45.191
That lovely face

00:49:45.524 --> 00:49:50.988
Just makes me smile

00:49:55.576 --> 00:49:57.912
You really are something, though.

00:49:58.396 --> 00:50:00.206
How did you memorize all the songs?

00:50:00.831 --> 00:50:04.376
What? Well, I got to learn
them by heart after a few times.

00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:06.128
You're a genius, aren't you?

00:50:06.921 --> 00:50:08.923
I'm not a genius.

00:50:11.909 --> 00:50:13.677
Right. The rock festival.

00:50:14.094 --> 00:50:15.095
Let's go together.

00:50:15.721 --> 00:50:17.097
Rock festival?

00:50:17.456 --> 00:50:20.184
Yes. I went to the one
in Incheon last year,

00:50:20.267 --> 00:50:21.935
and it was so fun.

00:50:22.978 --> 00:50:24.396
They're holding another one this year.

00:50:24.547 --> 00:50:25.815
You should come with me.

00:50:26.857 --> 00:50:28.609
I'd love that.

00:50:29.135 --> 00:50:30.236
Good. We're going.

00:50:30.736 --> 00:50:31.737
We're going.

00:50:32.488 --> 00:50:34.573
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

00:50:37.101 --> 00:50:38.544
No, I'm going home.

00:50:39.787 --> 00:50:42.206
Oh, sorry. Bye.

00:51:13.112 --> 00:51:14.488
It smells like cigarettes.

00:51:55.095 --> 00:51:56.488
It was so strange.

00:51:57.056 --> 00:51:59.450
How could the cigarette smell
I always hated

00:51:59.825 --> 00:52:01.785
suddenly feel so pleasant?

00:52:13.839 --> 00:52:15.174
Welcome.

00:52:24.166 --> 00:52:26.435
- The tickets are 80 dollars.
- Sorry?

00:52:28.295 --> 00:52:30.295
It's 80 dollars for a ticket?

00:52:33.425 --> 00:52:35.861
Twenty, thirty,

00:52:37.546 --> 00:52:38.905
forty,

00:52:40.749 --> 00:52:42.659
fifty...

00:52:43.077 --> 00:52:44.245
Okay.

00:52:47.398 --> 00:52:48.749
It's not even close.

00:53:07.585 --> 00:53:10.771
Mom.
Oh, your shoulders are all knotted up.

00:53:13.365 --> 00:53:15.510
Remember how you took

00:53:15.593 --> 00:53:18.446
all the New Year's money
and said you'd keep it safe?

00:53:19.079 --> 00:53:21.656
You still have that, right?

00:53:26.203 --> 00:53:27.830
- It's 49 dollars, so...
- Where is it?

00:53:28.322 --> 00:53:29.540
Where?

00:53:30.416 --> 00:53:32.501
Where did you keep the money?

00:53:33.957 --> 00:53:35.230
Mom, you said--

00:53:35.313 --> 00:53:37.669
Gosh, what are you blabbering about?

00:53:39.283 --> 00:53:41.594
How much was it? It was 49 and 58 dollars.

00:53:41.677 --> 00:53:43.429
Did you spend it all?

00:53:44.788 --> 00:53:46.014
You didn't, right?

00:53:48.677 --> 00:53:50.019
Mom?

00:53:52.104 --> 00:53:54.257
Let's see. A hundred dollars.

00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:56.817
So, that's 105 dollars. And 108 dollars.

00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:58.568
- It's 108 dollars.
- You did spend it.

00:54:03.098 --> 00:54:05.401
OWL BOOK AND VIDEO RENTAL STORE

00:54:05.484 --> 00:54:09.455
OWL BOOK AND VIDEO RENTAL STORE

00:54:12.199 --> 00:54:13.917
Hey, Dad...

00:54:15.043 --> 00:54:17.571
Can I get an allowance...

00:54:18.596 --> 00:54:20.973
Goodness. Hi.

00:54:21.366 --> 00:54:23.910
Mr. Won. I'm truly sorry.

00:54:23.994 --> 00:54:25.994
My savings account matures
the day after tomorrow.

00:54:26.077 --> 00:54:28.891
- I'll make sure to pay the rent then.
- Come on.

00:54:28.974 --> 00:54:30.974
That's not what I'm here for.

00:54:31.185 --> 00:54:33.229
I'm here to rent a video.

00:54:33.312 --> 00:54:35.312
I sincerely apologize.

00:54:35.395 --> 00:54:38.567
Oh, come on. That's not why I'm here.

00:54:38.926 --> 00:54:40.319
I just thought

00:54:40.402 --> 00:54:43.739
it was weird because you'd never miss
a rent payment.

00:54:43.822 --> 00:54:45.349
So, I thought something was wrong.

00:54:45.432 --> 00:54:48.119
I came by only because I was worried.

00:54:48.202 --> 00:54:51.063
You're not going through a hard time,
are you?

00:54:51.146 --> 00:54:53.232
Of course not.

00:54:53.315 --> 00:54:54.817
I see. Good.

00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:57.294
It's fine, so take your time.

00:54:57.377 --> 00:54:58.820
- Okay?
- Okay.

00:54:59.305 --> 00:55:02.133
- Sorry.
- Goodness.

00:55:03.467 --> 00:55:04.510
Right.

00:55:05.661 --> 00:55:08.264
- I'll rent this one.
- Sure.

00:55:11.183 --> 00:55:12.893
- That will be 1.50 dollars.
- What?

00:55:13.037 --> 00:55:15.562
- It's 1.50 dollars.
- Right. The money.

00:55:15.938 --> 00:55:18.232
You're right. I should pay. Let's see.

00:55:18.315 --> 00:55:19.525
- A dollar and 50 cents.
- Yes.

00:55:19.608 --> 00:55:20.692
Okay.

00:55:21.193 --> 00:55:22.736
Three more.

00:55:23.595 --> 00:55:25.364
- All right. Have a good night.
- Thank you.

00:55:25.447 --> 00:55:26.907
- Good night, sir.
- Bye.

00:55:32.663 --> 00:55:33.873
How much do you need?

00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:37.167
Oh, never mind. I'm fine.

00:55:37.501 --> 00:55:38.585
Give me a second.

00:55:44.716 --> 00:55:45.759
Is this enough?

00:55:47.719 --> 00:55:49.262
It's actually fine.

00:55:49.763 --> 00:55:50.806
Just take it.

00:55:52.808 --> 00:55:53.851
Come on.

00:55:55.502 --> 00:55:57.395
Thank you.

00:55:57.479 --> 00:55:58.647
Study hard.

00:56:01.441 --> 00:56:03.443
- I'll get going, then.
- Bye.

00:56:24.506 --> 00:56:26.133
It hit me all of a sudden.

00:56:27.593 --> 00:56:29.887
How does Seol-ha see me?

00:56:31.530 --> 00:56:32.806
Just a friend?

00:56:33.974 --> 00:56:35.142
Or...

00:56:56.313 --> 00:56:58.457
Do you want a sip?

00:57:09.259 --> 00:57:11.344
You really have a good eye.

00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:25.776
Never let go of my hand, Min-gi.

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:34.034
Memory gets reinterpreted
the way I want to remember it.

00:58:25.569 --> 00:58:27.955
SEARCH BY NAME, KWON SEOL-HA

00:58:28.038 --> 00:58:30.182
KWON SEOL-HA

00:58:32.509 --> 00:58:35.387
Certain that Seol-ha felt the same,

00:58:36.054 --> 00:58:38.056
and with the courage to open up...

00:58:43.562 --> 00:58:44.772
I finally told her

00:58:45.856 --> 00:58:47.524
how I felt.

00:58:55.991 --> 00:58:58.243
Good. It's all done.

00:59:14.384 --> 00:59:15.552
What's wrong?

00:59:16.504 --> 00:59:18.263
Is the reception bad?

00:59:20.098 --> 00:59:21.099
Whatever.

00:59:31.067 --> 00:59:32.121
And...

00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:34.446
Seol-ha

00:59:35.790 --> 00:59:37.790

00:59:53.882 --> 00:59:54.883
Oh, crap.
