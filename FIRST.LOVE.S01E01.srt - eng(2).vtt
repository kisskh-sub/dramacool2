Hey, Choi Bong-hee.
You do the asking.

00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:11.469
Hold the camcorder and talk?
Are you kidding me?

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.263
You're right, I'll film.

No way, you're working on it too, Blue?

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:21.855
You must be busy

but you're still doing all the schoolwork.
You're so amazing.

What does first love mean to you?

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.203
That's a secret.

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:38.621
That's boring.

No, I don't have one yet.

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:48.840
But does a crush count as first love?

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:51.593
- Of course not! It needs to go both ways.
- Yeah!

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:54.012
Then I don't know either.

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:57.932
Whether it's one-sided or mutual
if you felt love for the first time

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.268
isn't that your first love?

00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:03.438
Then what does "first love" mean to you?

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.566
Hmm...
Maybe an imprint?

00:01:07.358 --> 00:01:09.110
Something that leaves
a mark in every moment

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:14.449

Let's go, man.

00:09:22.311 --> 00:09:23.854
It's our last field trip.

00:09:31.612 --> 00:09:33.573
What are you guys going to wear
to the field trip?

00:09:33.906 --> 00:09:36.284
I'm going to go vintage.

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:37.827
You're not gonna wear
flower patterns, are you?

00:09:38.744 --> 00:09:41.998
It's not on the whole outfit.
Just a few to make it pop.

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:46.669
That's more like tacky than vintage.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.923
Sometimes, you're a total genius.

00:09:51.924 --> 00:09:55.011
How can anyone call you nice
when you throw shade like this?

00:09:55.928 --> 00:10:00.266
Hey, with curves like mine
you can never look tacky.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.519
But I mean, what would you guys know?

00:10:04.228 --> 00:10:06.147
You're so proud of those things.

00:10:06.397 --> 00:10:09.150

I don't see them.

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:13.070
What? Is he already leaving?

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:15.406
Why does he even bother coming to school?

00:10:15.698 --> 00:10:17.700
I mean, he should just transfer
to a school near his agency.

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:18.826
A five-hour commute is too long.

00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:20.995
His family lives here

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:24.498
- and he said he feels free
when he comes here.
- That's right.

00:10:24.957 --> 00:10:26.917
He said he feels refreshed
when he comes here.

00:10:28.544 --> 00:10:30.504
I hope Blue can come
on the field trip too.

00:10:30.504 --> 00:10:33.341
How could an idol go on a field trip?
That doesn't make any sense.

00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:45.519
- What is it?
- Huh?

00:10:46.687 --> 00:10:48.773
Just come right out and say it.

00:10:49.523 --> 00:10:52.234
Oh, so...

00:10:52.234 --> 00:10:54.236
We don't have anything next week, do we?

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:56.155
You have dance practice.

00:10:57.114 --> 00:10:59.617
Can I get out of it
if I memorize it by then?

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:03.162
Probably.

00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:07.458
Do you like school?

00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:09.502
Or do you like someone at school?

So I helped him.

00:24:35.056 --> 00:24:38.643
He came to give you rice cakes
because he moved nearby, right?

Dating rumors at 18? That’s a big shocker!

00:35:10.191 --> 00:35:12.902
No wonder he looked so cocky?

00:35:13.486 --> 00:35:16.739

All I did was say hello.

I know, the other team is just
pulling some noise marketing tricks.

Can you ask the manager
to put out an explanation?

If we do

it might make things worse
so they just want to wait and see.

You've got work overseas anyway so
you can't work in the country for a bit.

Then what about school?

00:35:57.363 --> 00:35:59.073
Well, you'll have to transfer to
a performing arts high school

00:35:59.073 --> 00:36:01.325
or drop out and take the GED.

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:18.009

Gosh, you scared me.

Lee Pa-ran, are you dumb?
How do I get you every time?

00:37:15.775 --> 00:37:17.902
You didn't.
I just pretended.

00:37:18.277 --> 00:37:20.112
That's hilarious.
Acting tough, huh?

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:42.927
Lee Pa-ran, you lost your touch.

00:37:46.847 --> 00:37:48.349
How'd you know I was here anyway?

00:37:50.059 --> 00:37:52.603
You always come here

Do I?

00:37:57.566 --> 00:37:58.818

What are you really curious about?

00:38:25.511 --> 00:38:28.556
I mean, you probably
saw her at music shows, right?

00:38:30.474 --> 00:38:32.226
What? Does it bother you?

You've helped me like a guardian angel
whenever I was going through tough times.

00:52:47.038 --> 00:52:50.709
and since I couldn't find a way
to thank you, I'm posting this video.

00:52:50.876 --> 00:52:52.878
Please continue to support me
like you are now.

00:52:52.878 --> 00:52:55.130
I'll always work hard
to become the best Blue I can.

00:52:55.338 --> 00:52:57.507
Thank you once again.

00:53:10.604 --> 00:53:13.356
Hey, can I go see Bong-hee one last time?

00:53:13.565 --> 00:53:16.151
You'll miss your flight, we need to hurry.

00:53:16.818 --> 00:53:19.821
I'll bring the car around
so hurry up, okay?

00:53:33.251 --> 00:53:34.669
Guys.

00:53:35.045 --> 00:53:37.047
Pa-ran dropped out today.

00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:42.802
Pa-ran.

00:53:44.512 --> 00:53:45.805
No!

00:53:45.805 --> 00:53:48.892
Lee Pa-ran.
You can't just leave like this.

00:53:49.476 --> 00:53:53.021
I even made a banner
so I could confess to you.

00:53:53.396 --> 00:53:55.941
I wanted to tell you
I've always been your fan

00:53:55.941 --> 00:53:58.902
and that I'm Choco Bong.

00:54:02.739 --> 00:54:04.074
- Is she confessing?
- Is she confessing?

00:54:33.061 --> 00:54:34.312
Lee Pa-ran!

00:54:48.576 --> 00:54:51.955
[Lee Pa-ran, I'll always be your fan]
[Choco Bong]

00:54:56.418 --> 00:54:59.671
You were Choco Bong?

00:55:00.463 --> 00:55:01.840
Yeah

00:55:02.424 --> 00:55:05.552
Your forever fan, that's me.

00:55:12.809 --> 00:55:14.436
[Lee Pa-ran, I'll always be your fan]
[Choco Bong]

00:55:21.526 --> 00:55:24.154
Have a safe trip, Lee Pa-ran.

00:55:25.155 --> 00:55:26.906
Thanks, Bong-hee.

00:55:43.965 --> 00:55:47.218
My first love is an idol.

00:55:47.594 --> 00:55:51.806
I don't expect anything in return.
I just wish for his happiness

00:55:51.973 --> 00:55:54.351
but loving someone who belongs to everyone

00:55:55.226 --> 00:55:57.520
can be lonely at times.

00:56:16.998 --> 00:56:19.876
[First Love]

00:56:19.876 --> 00:56:22.170
My name is Kang Hana.
I'm the class president of Class Three.

00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:24.005
We're here right now, so...

00:56:26.883 --> 00:56:28.134
Find it!

00:56:28.134 --> 00:56:29.386
I'll be right there.

00:56:29.386 --> 00:56:30.720
Please, just don't get into any trouble.

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:33.139
What? I can't date?

00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:39.604
I guess Hikari's face
makes her heart race.

00:56:39.604 --> 00:56:40.730
You're pretty.

00:56:47.612 --> 00:56:49.239
Are you really
in a relationship with Hana?

00:56:49.239 --> 00:56:50.990
- Na Haeri!
- What!

00:56:56.955 --> 00:56:58.164
You cheater.

00:57:00.708 --> 00:57:02.836
Kang Hana, you must be crazy.

00:57:03.628 --> 00:57:04.921
Hikari!

00:57:07.382 --> 00:57:08.633
Goodbye.
