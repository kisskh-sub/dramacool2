=Voyage to Haihun, Season 2=

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.300
=Episode 21=

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.380
(Yuzhang)

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.580
I've always been loyal.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.140
The Governor's army is well-drilled.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.380
They would never rebel.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.150
There must be some misunderstanding.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.720
It wasn't your soldiers who rebelled.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.200
Look at their expressions.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.830
They must be under Li Nvxu's Mishenfu.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.660
(Yuzhang)
Li Qi.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.900
You colluded with outside forces

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.870
and used innocent civilians as leverage.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.310
Where is your conscience?

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.280
Enough talk.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.470
You have no way out.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.150
Hand over the Emperor at once.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.610
Then these soldiers and civilians
can be spared.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.920
Otherwise, blades will be drawn,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.000
and blood will surely be spilled.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.270
Li Nvxu.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.820
His Majesty is burdened
with state affairs.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.240
Why would he come to Haihun?

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.800
Don't play dumb.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.910
The Emperor has come here in disguise.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.430
Right now, he is inside the city.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:34.800
I saw it with my own eyes

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.250
and heard it with my own ears.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.630
Li Nvxu.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.070
Leading troops to rebel
is punishable by death.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.680
Turn back now while you still can.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.870
I don't need

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.750
to follow your law.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.830
How disgraceful
to use the people as leverage!

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.100
Where do you think you're going?

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.860
I have the Huben Army's elites with me.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.230
I know the Breath Technique.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.560
I can get close. I can kill her.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.880
How will you make it back alive?

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.620
I...

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.680
I can't let you go.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.580
I ride fast.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.490
I can meet up with her.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.360
No way.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:20.750
I can't let you go, either.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.590
Please allow me

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.190
to lead troops to eliminate Li Nvxu.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.030
Absolutely not.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.860
The people are being used
as human shields.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:30.980
Once the fighting starts,

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.530
they'll be doomed for sure.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.460
Lord Sun,

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.640
you want to lead the troops?

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.000
Our troops are all below.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.430
Hold on.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:53.960
Listen carefully.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.750
Hand over Liu Xun at once.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.980
Otherwise,

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.720
the ground will be littered
with the dead,

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.070
and the rivers will run red

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.360
outside of the city today.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.570
Haihun

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.150
will become a city of death.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.920
Indecision

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.390
leads to chaos.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.000
Indecision

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.570
leads to chaos.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.750
They seek to destroy
both body and spirit.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.630
Indecision

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.070
leads to chaos.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.440
Is His Majesty

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:19.830
still safe?

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.540
The Huben Army
is already with His Majesty.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.120
Alright.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.560
Li Nvxu.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.360
The commoners are innocent.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:29.940
What is it you seek?

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.390
We can talk this through.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.560
Innocent?

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.870
When you harmed the people of Xiqiang,

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.120
did you ever think of our commoners?

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.310
We'd long lived in harmony.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.410
Xiqiang...

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.610
It was that treacherous Emperor
who sowed discord,

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.040
pitting our own kin against each other.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:48.680
Today,

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.510
I will capture Liu Xun.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.630
Let the Great Han taste as well

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.650
the chaos of a realm in turmoil

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.750
and the agony of kin turning on kin.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:59.350
Wait.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.720
Li Nvxu.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.890
His Majesty

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:05.840
is in the city.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.830
What if I can persuade His Majesty

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:10.560
to call back his troops?

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.850
An idea to buy us some time.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.360
We need to save the people.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.370
Brilliant, Marquis.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.920
Killing him will only vent your anger.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.920
If His Majesty decrees eternal peace
for Xiqiang,

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.000
you'd be a true hero to your clan.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.720
That would be a great deed.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.200
You think the likes of you
can sway the Emperor?

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.050
I am his uncle.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.280
This is his favored courtier.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.390
At a time like this,

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.650
spare us the sarcastic tone.

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:53.580
To show our sincerity,

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.760
you may enter the city

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.560
and talk to His Majesty.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:59.690
Ridiculous.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.120
You want me to walk into a trap?

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.560
Enough talking.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.630
Hand over Liu Xun now.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.940
Li Nvxu.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.630
Think about it.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.140
If, for the safety of your clan,

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.880
you enter alone

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.330
to negotiate,

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:16.340
you'll show your courage

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.710
and earn His Majesty's respect.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.680
He might agree to withdraw the troops.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:24.810
Li Nvxu.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.190
His Majesty is benevolent.

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.290
As long as no harm comes to the people,

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.710
everything can be discussed.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:32.870
Don't act rashly,

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.120
or you'll ruin everything.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.520
Mistress.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.510
The Huben Army is fierce and skilled.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:43.950
If they charge out of the city,

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.730
we may not be able to hold our ground.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.110
Why don't I head into the city first
to negotiate with them?

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.840
We can also test their true intentions.

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:53.350
Very well.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.310
I'll send someone inside.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.270
But I have one condition.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.800
Once the talks succeed,

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.630
the Emperor must leave the city
to issue the order to retreat.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.920
Have your Emperor prepare
the imperial decree

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.070
and bring it out personally.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.890
Then please keep your word.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:19.870
Harm no more innocents.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:21.800
Open the city gate.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.980
(Yuzhang)

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.560
So close.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:53.750
So close to tricking Li Nvxu
into our hands.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.040
Please calm your anger.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.880
We have to keep a cool head now.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.240
She's so cunning.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:59.700
She won't be fooled so easily.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.560
What matters now is
how to negotiate with Li Qi.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.160
You've thought of a way
to turn this around?

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.730
We can only take a gamble.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.920
Wang.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.800
I brought you Uncle Li's medicine chest.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:13.840
Okay.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.150
Don't worry.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:25.000
I've searched him.

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.670
Where is the Emperor now?

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.520
Li Qi.

00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:34.820
As a subject of the Great Han,

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.700
are you truly willing to serve
that woman from Xiqiang?

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.020
Where is the Emperor now?

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.630
His Majesty

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:43.870
is not in the city.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.080
Fine.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.100
I'll go report to Mistress at once.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:48.790
From here on,

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.580
it's no longer my concern.

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:51.630
Li Qi.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.530
Ever since leaving Changyi,

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:56.450
I've always treated you like a brother.

00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:59.840
I don't want you to end up like Bushi

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.540
and ruin yourself.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:03.390
Li Qi.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:05.600
As long as you haven't left here,

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.100
there's still time to turn back.

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:15.480
When the chaos
broke out in Wucheng Village,

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:17.520
where were you, my brother?

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:21.120
When a blade was pressed
against my neck,

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:23.880
where were you, my brother?

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.360
You

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.350
have risen to a high rank and honor,

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.390
respected wherever you go.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:32.920
You

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.320
still carry noble status

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:37.240
even after falling from the throne.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:38.720
But I

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.200
could only grovel
and cling to life in shame.

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:45.630
Now, I finally understand Bushi.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.470
You drove them to their deaths.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:48.550
That's not true.

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:51.030
You've simply fallen
under Li Nvxu's spell.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:52.780
You're just her pawn.

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.680
Better that than listening
to your wild tales.

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:55.820
Sometimes, lying comes

00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:00.120
from being too close to speak the truth.

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:04.550
This was entrusted to me
by Uncle Li before he died.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.900
He asked that I pass it to you one day.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.320
That day,

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.770
he drove a silver needle
into his forehead

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:12.180
and died right before my eyes.

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:14.340
Every word I've spoken is the truth.

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:17.860
If you don't believe me,

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.100
you can kill me right now.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:28.390
Then all grudges between us
will be settled.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.710
I have only one request.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.440
Tell Li Nvxu

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:34.310
that His Majesty is in the city.

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:35.510
Tell her you've made a deal,

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.980
and he will go and issue the decree.

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:37.820
Why?

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.120
This is our only chance to kill Li Nvxu.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.090
Aren't you afraid
I might expose your plan?

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:48.620
Right now,

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:52.870
I've got no other choice.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.550
Also,

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.360
I've always seen you as one of us.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.550
All the credit always goes to you.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:20.550
This is

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.600
our one and only shot.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.910
Have your Emperor draft a decree

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:40.610
and deliver it personally.

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:42.320
We must act without delay.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.160
Follow my lead.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:44.230
Milord Sun,

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:46.000
as per the prescription
obtained earlier,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.570
mobilize every pharmacy in the city

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.080
to brew the antidote now.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:50.860
- Yes.
- Scalp Wang.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.720
Take the men in the city with you.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.390
Come with me to pose
as His Majesty's men.

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:55.830
We'll ride out to meet Li Nvxu.

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:57.790
Once she nears our carriage,

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:58.660
kill her in one blow.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.200
Yes.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.040
De Jiu.

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:03.630
Send a Huben rider out at once

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:04.960
to report to His Majesty

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.880
and ask him
to send reinforcements immediately.

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:09.760
You and the rest of the Huben Army
stay in the city

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:11.270
to protect the commoners,

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:13.150
as well as the Marquis and Qingge.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.180
If I don't return,

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:17.820
seal the gates, stay inside,

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:18.790
and wait for rescue.

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:21.230
I can't obey that order.

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:22.450
I'm your superior.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.630
You have to follow my order.

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:24.790
I'm your buddy,

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:25.920
so you have to listen to me.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:26.840
Wang Heng.

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:28.130
I can't let you risk yourself.

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:29.210
Yes, Wang.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.070
If you're in danger,
how can we just stand by?

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:32.070
Don't worry.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:33.070
I can do parkour.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.360
They'll never catch me.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:36.440
That little skill you have
was taught by me.

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:37.440
Can you handle it?

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:38.320
I can ride a horse.

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:39.970
If needed, I can do it.

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:42.220
I've been an Emperor before.

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.670
Pretending to be the Emperor
is right up my alley.

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:45.510
No way.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.000
The strike is too important.

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:48.510
Your skills aren't up to it.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:50.550
I'd have to split my focus
to protect you.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:51.850
Qingge.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:53.530
This is nothing like the horse race.

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:54.990
Things are far more complicated now.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.910
As your elder brother,

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:57.430
I can't let you take such a risk.

00:12:58.290 --> 00:12:59.700
I want this plan to be flawless,

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:01.520
with no room for any mistakes.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.450
With me there,

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:03.790
there won't be the slightest slip.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:04.670
Marquis, Qingge,

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:06.610
you should stay in the city
and wait for orders.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.050
You and I will escort the carriage.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.260
Inside, I'll place a Huben soldier.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:13.990
With the Huben Army by its side,

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.980
Li Nvxu will think
His Majesty is within.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.050
Once she draws near,

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:18.020
we will strike together

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:18.870
and capture her.

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:22.960
This is my OK.

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:25.810
Where's yours?

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:35.200
I may not understand every word,

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:36.730
but it does make sense.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:38.800
You must be careful.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:40.400
Oh, right.

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:43.190
This is the antidote to Mishenfu

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.040
I prepared earlier.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:47.460
Make sure you take it on time.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.750
Don't act rashly.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.560
Heng.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.020
You must come back safe.

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:04.430
Of course.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.030
Don't forget about our gift

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:08.750
for two thousand years later.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:10.780
That's our promise.

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:12.980
I've picked the place.

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:14.110
Remember:

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:15.310
In Haihun,

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:16.360
go against the wind

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:17.420
for 50 li.

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:18.530
At the south of the waters,

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:19.860
chisel the turtle head place,

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:20.990
and the treasure will emerge.

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:22.390
Alright, I'll remember.

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:24.080
At a time like this,

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.720
you're still playing guessing games?

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.630
This isn't a game.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:29.800
It's a hope to hold on to.

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.320
With hope,

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:32.820
there's a goal to strive for.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.030
I have a hope.

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:46.240
When will you

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.320
grant me a post in Haihun?

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.760
You won't return to Chang'an?

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:55.150
No.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.570
Even if the Emperor

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.510
names you the Great General,

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:02.580
you won't go back?

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:03.590
I won't.

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:05.100
I'll stay here in Haihun.

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:06.840
When I return,

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.060
have this post carved for me.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.920
That's the task I'm giving you.

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:12.440
Why haven't you finished?

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:13.470
Go now.

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:14.500
