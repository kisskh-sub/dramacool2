=Episode 19=

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.080
Father,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.880
don't you recognize me now?

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.512
You...

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.144
You are...

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.480
That day, my mother

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.400
was beaten by you until she miscarried.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.800
I was drugged mute.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.240
For you,

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.840
my mother's life and mine

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.880
were even less valuable

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.240
than your trivial amusements.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.680
(Who's your mother?)

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.360
Qin Xiaoniang.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.640
That female physician?

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.080
Xiaoniang's carrying a child

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.400
in her womb.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.200
Madam Su ordered her beaten to death.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.000
Please save her.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.040
That countryside woman

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.320
is lucky to die

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.560
under my roof.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.040
Get lost.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.920
Stop ruining my mood.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.800
You're Yuqing?

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.200
My lord, this isn't your first brush

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.800
with death, huh?

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.760
If my mother hadn't saved you

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.040
from that cliff back then,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.960
she wouldn't get raped by you.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.040
She'd never have entered
the Duke's Mansion.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.080
She'd still be alive!

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.952
You

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.680
deserved death long ago.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.360
Qing.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.280
Please!

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.760
Save me!

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.920
I'll make it up to you!

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.280
My lord,

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.240
farewell.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.720
(Mother,)

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.400
(I've finally made the culprit
atone for his sins.)

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.880
Thank you for your help.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.120
No need for thanks.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.400
Without you,

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.040
I couldn't have avenged my husband.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.480
That day, when you exposed

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.240
the Duchess's crime

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.240
in the worship hall,

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.240
you gave me hope.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.640
The demoness has appeared.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.880
Chaos descends.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.560
You planted

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.280
these words

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.680
on Madam Su's corpse

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.520
and in the Duke's

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.240
arrogant schemes.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.600
Excuse me.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.800
Could you tell me

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.920
the way to Meixiang House?

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.424
That way.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.760
Which way?

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.520
That way?

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.808
There.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.840
(The demoness has appeared)
That way?

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.000
(Chaos descends)
I said that way!

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.400
You mean left?

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.800
It's over.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.208
What

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.680
will you do now?

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.240
I will take monastic vows.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.440
A life of devotion

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.400
amidst Buddha statues.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.200
Sounds rather desolate.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.960
That's not true.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.000
These past years,

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.200
I've never felt

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.080
such relief until now.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.320
Though my husband

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.640
rests beneath the earth,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.880
he can finally rest in peace.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.000
That brings me peace.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.280
And you?

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.720
Me?

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.880
The storm on my path

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.320
has yet to subside.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.512
Take care.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:35.904
Wait.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.400
This can't shield me from storms,

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.560
but it may warm you against the chill.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.560
I remember

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.200
there were many figures in it.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.936
Poorly rendered ones.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.480
So I painted over them.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.560
Might you

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.120
offer some advice?

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.640
Still refusing to be honest?

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.160
Is this your true purpose

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.320
for approaching me?

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.240
You understand me best.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.000
My weaknesses,

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.000
pain,

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:15.968
and desire

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.440
are all in your hands.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.280
I originally wanted
to wield you as a sword.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.040
But in fact,

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.440
you are the one holding the sword.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.800
How do you wish to deal with me?

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.360
Deal with?

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.840
With all your schemes,

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.960
you've finally made me fall for you.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.600
I only want to hear the truth.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.400
Slow down, Zhao.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.560
Be careful, Zhao.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.480
Don't fall down.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.280
Isn't you perfectly aware

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.560
of who I really am?

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.720
Zhao regards Shen Yuanjin
as his birth mother.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.320
I will never allow

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.400
Zhao to be harmed by anyone.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.040
Ye Xiyan,

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.960
I don't care what you plan to do.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:06.840
Stop this at once.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.480
The masters on the mountain
are extraordinary.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.160
(Pei Zhao, Heir of the Prince Regent)
Master Lin has peerless spear skills.

00:09:28.352 --> 00:09:30.640
Master Zhou wields sabers masterfully.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.280
And...

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.520
Mother,

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.800
why are you ignoring me again?

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.000
What I miss most

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.280
is still you.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.960
You indulge me in everything.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.000
The masters never do.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.080
Zhao,

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.480
I've raised you for three years.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.760
Now it's time for you
to repay this kindness.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.280
Master Zhao,

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:07.440
His Highness seeks you.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.184
Are you insane?

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:18.630
His Highness cares most about Zhao.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.280
If he discovers you're using Zhao,

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.840
he won't let you off easily.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.800
Yes, I'm insane.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.280
She caused both my mother
and father's deaths.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.360
The Western Army isn't
under the Duke's control.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.480
And the Empress Dowager
refuses to see me.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.040
If I don't act soon,

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.720
I'll be the next to die.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.200
So you'd drag

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.560
Zhao into this conflict?

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.400
We've worked hard to raise Zhao.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.520
Do you think this doesn't pain me?

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.456
Changyi.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.840
This is my only option left.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.760
I would never harm Zhao.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.440
All these years,

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.200
we three weren't a true family,

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.920
yet bound tighter than any kin.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.680
Wasn't that good enough?

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.960
Don't you wish to return to those days?

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.120
What are you trying to do?

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.920
Abdication and yielding
to worthier candidates.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.544
Qing,

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.000
you've won.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.840
All affairs
of the Prince Regent's Mansion

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.440
shall be managed by you.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.064
I'll return Zhao

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.600
to you too.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.400
His Highness hasn't punished you.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.600
Why go to such lengths?

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.240
I was wrong in the past.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:51.960
For the rest of my life,

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.400
I'll chant scriptures before Buddha,

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.920
atoning to you and Qin Xiaoniang.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.480
I only hope

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.880
you'll consider
how I treated Zhao as my own,

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.320
raising him with care,

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.080
and forgive me.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.560
This is the swaddling clothes Zhao wore

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:41.600
when first brought back.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.240
Such a tiny infant,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.200
with feeble cries,

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.080
like a little kitten.

00:13:49.152 --> 00:13:51.040
At Zhao's first birthday,

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.280
he grabbed this wooden sword.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.880
When Zhao first learned Luban locks,

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.440
he couldn't open them.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.840
So he threw them angrily on the floor

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.560
and then picked them up,

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.040
trying learning slowly.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.840
I have no interest
in raising another's child.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.000
I know you hate me.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.480
But Zhao has always seen me
as his mother.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.200
If you kill me,

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.320
how will he view you

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.200
when he learns of it?

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.200
You should cultivate virtue.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.160
Refrain from meddling
in worldly matters.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:41.856
Hit you.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.640
Who told you

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.440
to bring her steamed buns
and pickles daily?

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.000
I'll hit you.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:53.960
I'll kill you!

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.104
Stop!

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.824
Stop!

00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.720
You villain!

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.560
It was you!

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.520
You harmed my mother!

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.480
I'll hit you!

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.120
(Shen Yuanjin,)

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.320
(how dare you raise Zhao
to be so spoiled?)

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.960
How dare you harm me?

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.840
You can treat others this way,

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.990
and I'll treat you the same.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.840
My father is the Prince Regent!

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.560
I'll have him kill you!

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:17.960
Prince Regent, huh?

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:19.440
Fine.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.440
Let me show you

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.840
what the Prince Regent can do.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.040
