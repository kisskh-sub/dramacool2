[First Love]

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:13.179
People say the reason we can't forget
our first love is because

00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:17.225
it's our first.
Because we miss when we were innocent

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:19.561
or because it left us wanting more.

00:00:20.228 --> 00:00:23.106
But according to psychology

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:25.817
it's due to the Zeigarnik effect.

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:28.445
The Zeigarnik effect

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:30.196
is when we can't easily

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:33.199
let go of things that feel incomplete.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:37.579
A good example is when you're watching
a drama and it ends on a cliffhanger.

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:41.249
You can't wait to see what happens next.

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.841
If someone is struggling
to get over their first love

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:53.344
how about using
the Zeigarnik effect to your advantage?

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:58.099
Tell yourself, "It's over"
"Goodbye"

00:00:58.516 --> 00:01:00.852
to close that chapter of your life

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.938
so you don't have any regrets.

Hey, what are you doing?
Give me my test back!

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.810
What do you think you're doing?

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.941
You did write it with a pencil...

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:51.778
Yes ma'am, I just couldn't
go over my answers with a pen.

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:55.323
It might be tricky
to accept due to the rules.

00:01:55.323 --> 00:01:56.699
But

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.036
I dropped my pen because
Haeri bumped me with her arm.

00:02:00.036 --> 00:02:02.288
It's not because I ran out of time.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.292
But we have no way to prove it.
We don't even have CCTVs in the classroom.

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:13.133
But your work is perfect, so you
probably won't get a big deduction.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.676
Don't worry.

00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:24.811
Yeah, so don't mess up next time.

00:02:28.022 --> 00:02:30.024
Yeah, mess up.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.694
Your mistake of not keeping track of time.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.696
Am I wrong?

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:39.159
Or was it because of your desire
to rise from humble beginnings?

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:52.255
The top two students
in the school are fighting!

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:55.508

00:03:00.471 --> 00:03:03.099
You guys call yourselves model students?
This is ridiculous.

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.935
What? Should I
bring this to the school board?

00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:10.940
You're scared of that
but you go and fight?

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:17.238
Just apologize and end this.

- Haeri, could you give us a moment?
- Okay.

If you're worried about your scholarship
I'll help you out.

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:57.195
Haeri will probably let you have it.

No.

Do you want to be a guide
for an exchange student?

You can get a scholarship that way too.

00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:30.812
I'm Sato Hikari
and I'm from Tokyo, Japan.

00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:35.024
I applied for the exchange program
because I love Korean culture.

with you over the next month.

Hikari's not that great at speaking
but his listening skills are strong

No, I'm just talking statistics.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.790
But

00:13:11.707 --> 00:13:13.501
the man's not wearing a uniform.

00:13:15.252 --> 00:13:18.088

00:13:24.678 --> 00:13:27.807
It's because of people like you
that things get blown out of proportion.

but could you pretend
you didn't see my mom?

00:14:53.267 --> 00:14:55.686
I actually called you out here
to ask you that.

00:14:56.437 --> 00:15:01.650
So, are you okay with letting them think
your mom is your boyfriend?

00:15:01.984 --> 00:15:04.695
Yeah, I don't care.

00:15:08.866 --> 00:15:12.745

Yes, it's number ten on my bucket list.

I still need to try, right?

00:15:35.476 --> 00:15:37.436
I promised your mom.

00:15:39.188 --> 00:15:43.943
My mom doesn't understand what's going on
sometimes, so she can be stubborn.

00:15:47.071 --> 00:15:52.034
So what I mean is, you don't have to
keep your promise with my mom.

Do you decide
whether to keep promises

depending on who you promised?

00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:06.090
I know it's like looking
for a needle in a haystack

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.926
but if I keep looking
I'm sure I'll find it.

Mom, I didn't make
any friends so I could study.

00:18:39.368 --> 00:18:42.204

You're more like Wonder Woman.

00:28:03.139 --> 00:28:06.101
A Wonder Woman who protects her family.

00:28:07.936 --> 00:28:09.771
Wonder Woman...

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:11.523
I like that.

00:28:14.025 --> 00:28:15.735
Anyway, Hana.

00:28:15.985 --> 00:28:19.656
How did the lucky coin
become a lucky coin?

00:28:23.159 --> 00:28:26.871
When my dad was young

00:28:27.497 --> 00:28:31.459
he tossed a lucky coin
to wish for a girlfriend

00:28:32.043 --> 00:28:35.839
but instead of landing in the fountain
it landed in front of my mom.

00:28:36.339 --> 00:28:40.427
So, to celebrate that
my dad made the necklace.

00:28:40.927 --> 00:28:43.680
Wow, that really is a lucky coin.

00:28:44.139 --> 00:28:47.225
That coin is the reason you were born.

00:28:50.979 --> 00:28:54.357
Hana's mom is stupid.

00:28:54.399 --> 00:28:57.986
Stupid, stupid.

00:28:57.986 --> 00:29:00.113
My mom's not stupid!

00:29:00.447 --> 00:29:02.991
She's not stupid!

00:29:23.261 --> 00:29:27.098
I didn't know I'd find someone
I would want to give it to.

00:29:28.349 --> 00:29:32.771
The expression we’ll be
learning today is "nakereba naranai."

00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:36.024
[Hello, Japanese Lesson]
This means "must"

00:29:36.691 --> 00:29:39.819
but lots of you hear "nakereba naranai"

00:29:39.819 --> 00:29:42.739
and think that it means "should"

00:29:42.739 --> 00:29:47.285
but it doesn't match
the meaning of the Korean word

00:29:47.285 --> 00:29:49.370
so nakereba naranai...

00:29:52.999 --> 00:29:54.959
Kang Hana, you must be crazy.

00:30:38.294 --> 00:30:39.504
Mom.

00:30:40.213 --> 00:30:41.798
I'm going to school.

00:30:41.798 --> 00:30:45.301
Wow, you put your hair down?

00:30:46.219 --> 00:30:48.930
Oh, yeah...

00:30:49.639 --> 00:30:52.767
Great job, my daughter.

00:30:53.101 --> 00:30:54.561
You look so pretty.

00:30:56.813 --> 00:30:58.273
I'll be back.

00:30:58.731 --> 00:31:00.567
Have fun, princess.

00:31:14.914 --> 00:31:17.917
Similarly, here's the view of
Gangneung, Jumunjin, and Sacheon

00:31:17.917 --> 00:31:20.295
where a heavy rain warning has been issued.

00:31:20.295 --> 00:31:23.298
Currently, it's raining 10mm per hour...

00:31:23.298 --> 00:31:25.717
Hana didn't take her umbrella

00:31:26.634 --> 00:31:28.177
Mainly along the East Coast...

00:31:33.057 --> 00:31:34.434
Hana!

00:31:36.311 --> 00:31:37.812
What? Mom!

00:31:38.104 --> 00:31:39.397
Why'd you come?

00:31:40.231 --> 00:31:42.066
It's going to rain later.

00:31:42.066 --> 00:31:44.110
You'll catch a cold if you get wet.

00:31:44.694 --> 00:31:46.821
Okay, go back home.

00:31:47.238 --> 00:31:48.698
Please hurry up and go.

00:31:52.368 --> 00:31:53.661
Young-suk.

00:31:53.661 --> 00:31:55.914
If you're on your way to the center
do you want to come with me?

00:31:55.914 --> 00:31:58.041
I'm going to head over
after I drop my daughter off.

00:31:58.625 --> 00:32:02.253
No, I have to go change at home.

00:32:02.253 --> 00:32:03.463
Okay, then.

00:32:03.463 --> 00:32:05.798
- See you later.
- Okay, boss's wife.

00:32:13.181 --> 00:32:14.807
Mom, who is that?

00:32:14.807 --> 00:32:17.226
I told you there's a disabled barista
at the café in Dad’s hospital.

00:32:17.226 --> 00:32:18.269
That's her.

00:32:19.562 --> 00:32:22.357
I guess the daughter that she always
brags about goes to Soorim High.

00:32:22.941 --> 00:32:25.360
She said she has
the best grades at school.

00:32:28.404 --> 00:32:31.324
Don't tell me
you lost your spot to her.

00:32:33.201 --> 00:32:36.079
How could you lose
your spot to someone like her?

00:32:36.412 --> 00:32:39.374
What did you say when I told you to go
to a science high school like your sister?

00:32:39.374 --> 00:32:40.625
You said you'd go to a regular school

00:32:40.625 --> 00:32:42.502
get a recommendation from the principal
and get into Seoul National University!

00:32:46.381 --> 00:32:48.257
She's not trying to get into
med school too, is she?

00:32:55.556 --> 00:32:58.601
Hana, you put your hair down today.

00:33:02.939 --> 00:33:04.023
Yeah.

00:33:04.732 --> 00:33:05.942
You're pretty.

00:33:10.321 --> 00:33:12.031
Oh, right.

00:33:12.407 --> 00:33:16.035
This is a charm I bought from a shrine
dedicated to academic success

00:33:16.995 --> 00:33:18.871
and it's supposed to be very effective.

00:33:20.289 --> 00:33:21.833
It's an omamori.

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:23.584
Thanks.

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:26.462
Of course you know what it's called.

00:33:30.675 --> 00:33:33.553
Hana, make sure
to get into Seoul University

00:33:34.429 --> 00:33:36.389
and come to Japan to return this to me.

00:33:38.474 --> 00:33:41.310
You need to get rid of it
at the box at Yushima Tenjin.

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:44.647
If you throw it away anywhere else
the gods will get angry.

00:33:45.314 --> 00:33:47.400
Okay, I will.

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.235
Really? Will you really come?

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:52.530
Wow, you promise?

00:33:52.905 --> 00:33:54.198
I promise.

00:33:56.951 --> 00:33:58.953
What? It was her mom?

00:33:59.579 --> 00:34:02.415
Why would she lie about that?

00:34:02.415 --> 00:34:04.125
Don't you get it?

00:34:05.501 --> 00:34:06.669
What?

00:34:07.295 --> 00:34:08.755
What?

00:34:15.803 --> 00:34:16.971
What's going on?

00:34:19.557 --> 00:34:22.268
What is it again? Tell me.

00:34:22.268 --> 00:34:24.187
I guess your mom is your boyfriend.

00:34:25.313 --> 00:34:27.356
Did you seize your opportunity and lie

00:34:27.356 --> 00:34:29.108
because you were
embarrassed of being single?

00:34:29.275 --> 00:34:33.821
No, to be exact
she was embarrassed of her mom.

00:34:33.821 --> 00:34:36.449
Her mom's a bit different from others.

00:34:36.657 --> 00:34:38.618
- Na Haeri!
- What?

00:34:39.994 --> 00:34:41.621
You don't like me talking about your mom?

00:34:41.621 --> 00:34:43.539
Is that why you lied
about having a boyfriend?

00:34:44.582 --> 00:34:46.250
Hana didn't lie.

00:34:47.627 --> 00:34:49.378
Hana does have a boyfriend.

00:34:50.213 --> 00:34:52.632
Who is it? Did you see him?

00:34:53.299 --> 00:34:54.509
Yeah.

00:34:56.052 --> 00:34:57.970
I'm her boyfriend.

00:35:01.516 --> 00:35:03.059
Get back to your seats!

00:35:04.435 --> 00:35:05.978
What's with all the commotion?

00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:13.277
A student-teacher will be
observing our class today.

00:35:35.466 --> 00:35:37.426
Does Kang Hana suffer from panic disorder?

00:35:38.553 --> 00:35:40.721
I don't think I've ever
seen her take medicine.

00:35:42.515 --> 00:35:43.850
Hikari.

00:35:44.267 --> 00:35:46.269
Are you really
in a relationship with Hana?

00:35:47.186 --> 00:35:48.771
Why would you ask me that?

00:35:49.147 --> 00:35:51.190
Because you're too good for her.

00:35:51.566 --> 00:35:53.359
Hana has a terrible personality.

00:35:53.693 --> 00:35:56.070
Oh, do you not know what that means?

00:35:57.071 --> 00:36:01.993
You're just too good for her.
Hana only cares about herself.

00:36:01.993 --> 00:36:03.911
Do you get what I'm saying?

00:36:04.579 --> 00:36:06.914
Maybe that's just what you believe.

00:36:09.417 --> 00:36:10.960
You're such a pain in the ass.

00:36:11.419 --> 00:36:12.628
Hey!

00:36:12.879 --> 00:36:17.008
You're the kind of person who digs up
wounds others are trying to hide.

00:36:17.341 --> 00:36:19.760
Think about what a tough time
she must've gone through.

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.345
Do you not have a brain?

00:36:21.679 --> 00:36:22.763
Hey.

00:36:23.472 --> 00:36:27.101
Someone who's ashamed of their disabled
mom is the one who should be ashamed!

00:36:27.101 --> 00:36:29.228
I just helped her realize that.

00:36:29.228 --> 00:36:32.106
Yeah! Haeri's right.

00:36:32.106 --> 00:36:35.151
- What are you talking about?
- Why are you shouting?

00:36:35.484 --> 00:36:38.738
- Who are you to say that?
- What's this got to do with you?

00:36:43.701 --> 00:36:45.077
Mom.

00:36:45.369 --> 00:36:48.414
It's not a big deal.
Why are you crying?

00:36:50.499 --> 00:36:53.920
It's vasovagal syncope.

00:36:56.422 --> 00:36:59.675
They said you'll faint again
if you're stressed.

00:36:59.675 --> 00:37:02.595
No, I might.

00:37:04.263 --> 00:37:08.059
It's like a severe case of anemia
so don't worry about it.

00:37:08.643 --> 00:37:13.064
There's not really a cure
and it's not harmful.

00:37:13.439 --> 00:37:14.982
Really?

00:37:15.191 --> 00:37:16.400
Yeah.

00:37:16.692 --> 00:37:19.654
If I feel it coming on

00:37:20.321 --> 00:37:24.033
I just have to lower my head
towards my heart like this.

00:37:24.367 --> 00:37:25.660
Oh...

00:37:26.786 --> 00:37:29.288
Still, you have to rest for a few days.

00:37:29.664 --> 00:37:32.208
You can't go to school to study.

00:37:33.292 --> 00:37:34.543
Yeah.

00:37:35.336 --> 00:37:37.255
I'm not going to go to school.

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:40.591
Alright.

00:37:41.133 --> 00:37:44.345
Hana will be absent
until she recovers

00:37:44.345 --> 00:37:47.515
- so the vice president needs to step up.
- Okay.

00:37:48.224 --> 00:37:50.476
As for Hikari's guide...

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:54.188
- Haeri speaks Japanese, so can you help?
- Sure.

00:37:54.647 --> 00:37:57.942
Alright, see you tomorrow.

00:37:58.442 --> 00:38:01.570
- Bye.
- Go right home.

00:38:02.488 --> 00:38:04.824
Hana must be super embarrassed.

00:38:04.824 --> 00:38:06.867
She's not the type
to miss school with finals coming up.

00:38:06.867 --> 00:38:09.578
You don't think
she pretended to faint, do you?

00:38:09.578 --> 00:38:11.998
Wow, if that's the case...

00:38:12.581 --> 00:38:14.583
She deserves an Oscar.

00:38:15.293 --> 00:38:16.544
You two.

00:38:17.295 --> 00:38:18.713
Are you guys really her friends?

00:38:19.964 --> 00:38:22.174
How could you say
something like that like it's nothing?

00:38:22.633 --> 00:38:25.511
It's just a joke, a joke.

00:38:25.845 --> 00:38:27.555
If you think that's funny

00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:30.725
Hana's not the sick one.
You are.

00:38:36.397 --> 00:38:38.149
You guys are a disgrace to the country.

00:38:44.905 --> 00:38:48.075
Hana, do you feel any better?

00:38:48.826 --> 00:38:51.370
I heard you got
discharged from the hospital.

00:38:52.371 --> 00:38:55.166
I'm glad it's not too serious.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.004
Rest up, and see you tomorrow.

00:39:02.923 --> 00:39:05.343
Hana has been absent for four days.

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:07.720
Shouldn't we go see her?

00:39:08.679 --> 00:39:10.222
What if she gets overwhelmed?

00:39:11.724 --> 00:39:13.267
Yeah, but...

00:39:14.268 --> 00:39:16.896
I don't want her to think
there's no one on her side.

00:39:18.606 --> 00:39:20.691
I didn't think that far.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:26.030
You could just text her
like you always do.

00:39:26.906 --> 00:39:29.992
- Yeah, that sounds good.
- Yeah.

00:39:30.326 --> 00:39:32.495
I'm busy because of the festival anyway

00:39:32.495 --> 00:39:35.039
so I'll whine about having to do it alone.

00:39:36.165 --> 00:39:38.751
Sunwoo, you're amazing.

00:39:38.793 --> 00:39:41.379
What? This is nothing.

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:54.934
Oh! You're Hana's friend.

00:39:54.934 --> 00:39:56.602
Oh, hello.

00:39:56.602 --> 00:39:59.688
I came because Hana was "kesseki."

00:39:59.688 --> 00:40:01.190
Is Hana okay?

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:03.234
Why is Hana a "kesseki?"

00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:05.736
Why would you call Hana that?

00:40:05.736 --> 00:40:07.571
Oh, no.

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:11.867
"Kesseki" means you don't
show up to school in Japanese.

00:40:12.493 --> 00:40:15.162
- Absent?
- Yeah, absent.

00:40:15.162 --> 00:40:17.832
That's "kesseki" in Japanese.

00:40:17.832 --> 00:40:21.085
- I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.
- Oh, I see.

00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:24.380
You scared me. I thought
you were calling Hana a bad word.

00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:27.341

If he was going to die
without taking responsibility for her

00:44:34.088 --> 00:44:36.298
he shouldn't have married her.

my parents wouldn't have met

00:59:29.899 --> 00:59:31.776
I'll miss you.

00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:38.408
Study hard and become a doctor.

00:59:40.577 --> 00:59:41.744
Okay.

00:59:45.957 --> 00:59:47.250
Then...

00:59:50.003 --> 00:59:51.504
Goodbye.

01:00:28.249 --> 01:00:30.293
Dude, you're basically
inviting in mosquitoes.

01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:34.839
Hikari asked me to give this to you.

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:36.799
Huh?

01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:40.595
Thanks.

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:57.403
[To Hana]

01:00:57.403 --> 01:01:00.740
To Hana, who helped me during
my month as an exchange student.

01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:04.077
Thanks to you, I was happy in Korea.

01:01:04.952 --> 01:01:07.914
I'll miss you a lot
once I return to Japan.

01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:11.668
I'll especially miss
seeing you study hard.

01:01:13.086 --> 01:01:16.881
Let's both work hard
and get into the universities we want.

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:20.009
And if you get into Seoul University

01:01:20.009 --> 01:01:22.261
you have to come to Japan
to return the omamori.

01:01:23.554 --> 01:01:25.765
If you don't, the gods will get angry.

01:01:27.475 --> 01:01:31.813
And the Japanese coin
is a present for you.

01:01:33.439 --> 01:01:38.027
In Japan, the five-yen coin is called
the coin of fate, or a lucky coin.

01:01:39.612 --> 01:01:43.324
"Go-en" sounds similar
to the Japanese word that means fate

01:01:43.324 --> 01:01:46.619
and they say luck comes and goes
through the hole in the coin.

01:01:47.745 --> 01:01:49.872
I hope you take all the luck.

01:01:50.331 --> 01:01:53.543
I wish you all the best of luck.
Sato Hikari.

01:02:15.857 --> 01:02:18.317
To me, first love

01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:22.238
is the feeling I never got to confess.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.637
[First Love]

01:02:46.888 --> 01:02:50.433
How would you feel if the person you liked
was in love with someone else?

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:52.560
How about you? Tell me.

01:03:00.943 --> 01:03:03.863
- Are you crazy? Hey!
- Stop it! Hey!

01:03:03.863 --> 01:03:05.406
Do you have an inferiority complex?

01:03:05.406 --> 01:03:06.699
Why!

01:03:06.699 --> 01:03:08.159
[Nam Hao]

01:03:12.830 --> 01:03:14.207
What are you doing?

01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:16.667
Just get lost!

01:03:16.667 --> 01:03:17.794
You're so annoying.

01:03:19.337 --> 01:03:22.673
The guy who claims to be my dad's son
showed up at our house.

01:03:22.673 --> 01:03:24.425
These two are brothers.

01:03:24.926 --> 01:03:27.470
Every day is like hell because I'm scared
people will find out we're brothers!

01:03:29.597 --> 01:03:31.098
He went international, huh?
