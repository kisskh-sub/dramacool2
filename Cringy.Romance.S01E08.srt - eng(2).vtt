THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION

WERE STRICTLY FOLLOWED DURING FILMING

00:00:45.888 --> 00:00:48.966
Hui-seon's mom had
debts of 15,000 dollars.

00:00:49.491 --> 00:00:53.011
And Hui-seon has been
paying all of that back.

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:57.057
Then, her mom borrowed 20,000 dollars more
and disappeared.

00:00:57.641 --> 00:00:59.268
Darn it.

00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:02.312
No wonder she ran away.

00:01:34.061 --> 00:01:36.722
She even quit her job for me.

00:01:39.683 --> 00:01:41.560
She was looking into vocational schools

00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:44.062
and planned on getting her GED.

00:01:53.055 --> 00:01:54.948
What have I done to her?

00:02:01.038 --> 00:02:02.373
So, why did you do that,
in the first place?

00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:05.125
You should have gotten back with her
when she begged.

00:02:08.754 --> 00:02:09.938
I was afraid.

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:12.132
Afraid of what?

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:16.803
You know...

00:02:19.306 --> 00:02:20.307
Everything.

00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:32.360
She must have been...

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:36.031
even more afraid than I was.

00:02:40.185 --> 00:02:41.745
She must have suffered even more.

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:47.751
I'm a damn coward.

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:52.589
I'm a scumbag.

00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:57.552
Come on. Don't beat yourself up.

00:03:14.136 --> 00:03:15.269
It's adorable.

00:03:15.353 --> 00:03:17.472
- Seol-ha, show us.
- How many paper cranes are these?

00:03:17.555 --> 00:03:18.990
- A hundred?
- Guys.

00:03:19.073 --> 00:03:21.335
- Isn't this a love note?
- A what?

00:03:21.418 --> 00:03:22.436
What's that?

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.187
- I want to see it!
- That's so cute.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.747
Read it at home.

00:03:26.398 --> 00:03:28.166
I told you to read it at home!

00:03:35.365 --> 00:03:37.759
- I'll get you a proper gift!
- I said it was fine!

00:03:40.996 --> 00:03:42.764
- What was that?
- What happened?

00:03:42.847 --> 00:03:44.558
- My ankle!
- Are you hurt?

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:45.726
No!

00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:47.269
- No, it hurts!
- Let me take a look.

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:48.721
- Don't touch it!
- Take a look.

00:03:48.804 --> 00:03:50.898
- Are his bones okay?
- They seem fine.

What did you say you wanted to buy?

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.603
All Eyez on Me by Tupac.

00:06:34.686 --> 00:06:36.104
Oh, Tupac!

00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:40.275
Let's see. Anything else?

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:43.303
- No.
- You want porn too?

00:06:43.678 --> 00:06:45.780
- Do you also sell porn?
- Of course.

00:06:46.515 --> 00:06:49.117
If there's anything you need, ask me.
I can get them for you. Here.

00:06:53.138 --> 00:06:55.774
And it's real? It's not fake, is it?

00:06:56.758 --> 00:06:58.710
- Don't buy it.
- No.

00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:00.504
I'll take one more.

00:07:01.321 --> 00:07:02.422
What?

00:07:02.823 --> 00:07:04.550
I ordered two of these.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.969
It says, "Two CDs," here. That's a two.

00:07:08.078 --> 00:07:10.330
That means there are two CDs in an album.

00:07:10.413 --> 00:07:13.392
I said that I'd buy two of these albums.

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:15.819
That's what it meant?

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:17.187
Yes.

00:07:17.504 --> 00:07:21.149
But you can't find it anywhere else.
I barely got my hands on this one.

00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:23.843
- Oh, no.
- You don't want it?

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.154
I do want it.

00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:26.571
I'll buy this one, then.

00:07:27.681 --> 00:07:29.364
- How much is it?
- It's 15 dollars.

00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:31.009
- Can you meet me at 13--
- Don't buy it.

00:07:31.092 --> 00:07:32.410
Sorry.

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:33.662
Fifteen dollars.

00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:35.288
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

00:07:35.371 --> 00:07:36.456
- Thank you.
- Hey.

00:07:37.566 --> 00:07:39.418
Call me if you need porn.

00:07:39.818 --> 00:07:41.044
Sure.

00:07:41.528 --> 00:07:42.796
Have a good one.

00:08:00.864 --> 00:08:01.982
Hello?

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:03.692
It's been a while.

00:08:04.175 --> 00:08:05.485
It's me, Gwang-jae.

00:08:23.737 --> 00:08:27.507
Yo! Yeon to the Jeong!

00:08:27.991 --> 00:08:29.217
What's the occasion?

00:08:29.951 --> 00:08:32.178
Nothing. I just wanted to hang out.

00:08:32.804 --> 00:08:35.265
You even got us a table?
What are we celebrating?

00:08:35.874 --> 00:08:37.601
We're not celebrating.

00:08:37.876 --> 00:08:39.144
We're just going to have fun.

00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:40.687
Have a shot!

00:08:46.384 --> 00:08:47.694
- Here.
- Thanks.

00:08:53.683 --> 00:08:54.993
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:09:10.867 --> 00:09:13.386
When was the last time we saw each other?

00:09:14.204 --> 00:09:17.557
I'm not sure. It was probably a week ago.

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:20.810
It felt like a million years.

00:09:21.795 --> 00:09:22.938
Oh, right.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:25.649
- Here.
- What is it?

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:30.111
All Eyez on Me?

00:09:30.512 --> 00:09:32.030
I know you don't have that album.

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:34.492
- You can keep it.
- But it's hard to get one of these.

00:09:34.575 --> 00:09:35.614
How did you get it?

00:09:37.852 --> 00:09:38.911
Keep it.

00:09:39.979 --> 00:09:42.632
Didn't you say
you also didn't have this album?

00:09:44.375 --> 00:09:45.835
Just keep it.

00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:47.462
Let's drink.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.883
Gosh.

00:09:52.993 --> 00:09:54.845
- Awesome.
- Do you like it?

00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:57.347
Thank you.

00:10:17.709 --> 00:10:19.452
- Yeon-jeong.
- Yes?

00:10:20.337 --> 00:10:21.496
Be my girlfriend.

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:25.750
I said, "Be my girlfriend!"

00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:30.714
We're dating now, okay?

00:10:40.431 --> 00:10:41.515
What is this?

00:10:42.517 --> 00:10:43.810
Be my girlfriend!

00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:46.771
Do you mean that?

00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:48.940
Yes.

00:11:11.821 --> 00:11:12.922
What's wrong?

00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:16.384
We have similar taste in music,
we're both into hip-hop,

00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:18.302
and we vibe so well
when we dance at the club.

00:11:18.703 --> 00:11:21.180
Honestly, you have fun
when you're with me.

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:22.682
Admit it.

00:11:24.792 --> 00:11:25.685
Am I wrong?

00:11:27.378 --> 00:11:29.271
Did you think I'd be your girlfriend

00:11:29.772 --> 00:11:31.065
if you asked?

00:11:33.318 --> 00:11:34.694
Well,

00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:36.446
not exactly.

00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:41.367
Then,

00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:43.620
why did you

00:11:44.479 --> 00:11:45.622
sleep with me?

00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:56.633
I'm sorry.

00:11:56.866 --> 00:11:58.926
I wasn't asking for your apology.

00:11:59.285 --> 00:12:00.720
Also, why are you sorry?

00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:03.598
That's not what I'm trying to tell you.

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:06.768
Do you hate me?

00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:10.063
- It's not that.
- Doesn't that mean you like me?

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:11.981
Well, that's...

00:12:15.109 --> 00:12:17.285
I do have fun when I'm with you, but...

00:12:17.369 --> 00:12:18.404
But what?

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.658
But I think dating

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:23.785
is a different issue.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.121
Why?

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:29.540
I don't

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:31.918
know you that well.

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:34.737
What about you?

00:12:35.363 --> 00:12:36.506
Do you think you know me well?

00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:44.264
Goodbye.

with me.

00:14:43.274 --> 00:14:45.274

But I had...

00:15:29.954 --> 00:15:31.430
Why don't we go there next time?

00:15:32.373 --> 00:15:33.474
What?

00:15:33.833 --> 00:15:34.851
I mean,

00:15:35.293 --> 00:15:38.021
I had plans with a friend.

00:15:39.188 --> 00:15:40.648

00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:42.316

00:17:42.604 --> 00:17:44.627
and focus on your grades
in the second semester.

00:17:45.798 --> 00:17:48.567
I'm close to clearing all my debt now.
All right?

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.496
Mom.

00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:02.705
What?

00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:13.676
Anyway, when I'm gone,

00:18:13.802 --> 00:18:14.786
I'll be running

00:18:14.869 --> 00:18:17.221
a kkakdugi fried rice place there,
so find me there.

00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:20.475
What is that place? America?

00:18:21.792 --> 00:18:23.018
It's San Francisco.

00:18:32.803 --> 00:18:33.904
Gi-hyeok.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.407
Do you seriously think that's plausible?

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:37.950
Listen.

00:18:38.033 --> 00:18:40.494
There's no guarantee
that Hui-seon went to the US.

00:18:40.786 --> 00:18:42.538
Fine. Say she went there.

00:18:42.913 --> 00:18:45.415
How are you going to find her
in that huge country?

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:49.337
She could be in San Francisco,
she could be in LA,

00:18:49.452 --> 00:18:51.452
or she could be in Los Angeles.

00:18:51.855 --> 00:18:52.881
Who knows?

00:18:53.324 --> 00:18:55.243
Okay. Let's say you luckily found her.

00:18:55.326 --> 00:18:57.386
You find her,
but she already has a new boyfriend,

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:00.473
and his name is James or Michael.

00:19:00.556 --> 00:19:01.899
Then, what?

00:19:02.166 --> 00:19:04.310
- I wouldn't know what to do.
- Seriously?

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:05.936
Why would you say that and ruin the mood?

00:19:08.339 --> 00:19:09.398
I mean,

00:19:10.107 --> 00:19:11.233
I'm just saying.

00:19:13.361 --> 00:19:14.737
Let's drink, guys.

00:19:15.638 --> 00:19:17.573
Hey, go and find Hui-seon.

00:19:17.656 --> 00:19:19.200
- I will.
- You too.

00:19:30.361 --> 00:19:31.879
You're out of your mind.

00:19:33.197 --> 00:19:35.549
You're crazy, dude!

00:19:37.685 --> 00:19:39.470
Yes, he is.

00:19:39.629 --> 00:19:41.722
You're definitely crazy.

00:19:41.805 --> 00:19:43.432
Get back safely.

00:19:44.392 --> 00:19:45.476
- I still can't believe it.
- Man.

00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:47.228
He's actually going.

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:50.939
He's something.

00:19:51.357 --> 00:19:54.151
Act like you approve. Smile.
Good choice, dude.

00:19:56.287 --> 00:19:57.321
Here.

00:20:00.407 --> 00:20:01.433
What is this?

00:20:01.659 --> 00:20:03.160
We all chipped in.

00:20:03.728 --> 00:20:05.121
They're dollars,
so use them when you arrive.

00:20:07.957 --> 00:20:09.125
Take it.

00:20:15.005 --> 00:20:16.015
Thanks.

00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:18.092
Make sure to contact us when you land.

00:20:18.467 --> 00:20:19.468
I will.

00:20:21.387 --> 00:20:23.764
Are you sure you're all right?

00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:26.975
Forget about me. Worry about yourself.

00:20:29.145 --> 00:20:30.521
This guy.

00:20:31.005 --> 00:20:33.065
Now I see it.
You've got some serious balls.

00:20:33.274 --> 00:20:35.776
- You think I'm cool?
- You're super cool, dude.

00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:38.488
Let's have a drink when you get back.

00:20:39.488 --> 00:20:40.489
Go on.

00:20:42.767 --> 00:20:44.118
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:20:56.046 --> 00:20:57.172
- Bye!
- Bye!

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:05.222
- He's actually gone.
- I know.

00:21:09.435 --> 00:21:12.355
Still, he won't regret anything.

00:21:28.913 --> 00:21:31.833
Still, he won't regret anything.

00:21:45.813 --> 00:21:50.209
SEOKMO ISLAND TRIP

00:22:10.454 --> 00:22:11.580
Ju-yeon--

00:22:31.225 --> 00:22:33.727
What do you think about me?

00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:36.063
What do you mean?

00:22:37.022 --> 00:22:38.482
You know,

00:22:38.758 --> 00:22:39.901
just...

00:22:40.693 --> 00:22:43.529
Girls aren't really into guys like me,
are they?

00:22:43.821 --> 00:22:45.821
That's not true.

00:22:46.323 --> 00:22:48.575
You're a pretty good guy.

00:22:48.802 --> 00:22:51.404
Girls are into guys like you.

00:22:52.587 --> 00:22:53.587
Is that right?

00:22:59.503 --> 00:23:00.796
Ju-yeon.

00:23:01.183 --> 00:23:02.170
Yes?

00:23:02.253 --> 00:23:03.253
If...

00:23:04.174 --> 00:23:06.426
you're okay with it, should we go out?

00:23:07.369 --> 00:23:08.387
I'm sorry?

00:23:09.889 --> 00:23:10.890
Oh,

00:23:11.999 --> 00:23:13.225
well...

00:23:13.767 --> 00:23:15.310
I knew you wouldn't like me.

00:23:15.393 --> 00:23:18.105
No, that's not what I mean.

00:23:20.239 --> 00:23:21.247
Then, what?

00:23:37.625 --> 00:23:39.836
Wait. Aren't you Jun-seok?

00:23:40.794 --> 00:23:42.337
Are you going somewhere?

00:23:42.488 --> 00:23:44.799
I'm going to return these videotapes.

00:23:45.157 --> 00:23:46.367
- Go on.
- Bye.

00:23:55.209 --> 00:23:56.252
Mr. So!

00:23:56.453 --> 00:23:59.122
- What?
- You can't return them right now.

00:23:59.398 --> 00:24:02.024
What are you talking about?
He called and asked me to return them.

00:24:02.107 --> 00:24:04.343
That can't be right.
I just heard that they weren't available.

00:24:04.426 --> 00:24:05.986
Why wouldn't they be available?

00:24:06.069 --> 00:24:08.069
- Then, I'll watch them and return them.
- Are you insane?

00:24:08.152 --> 00:24:10.074
There's going to be a late fee
if I don't return them now.

00:24:10.157 --> 00:24:12.205
- I'll pay the late fee.
- No, kid!

00:24:12.289 --> 00:24:14.536
- I need to write a movie review!
- What?

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:16.037
Hey, stop!

00:24:18.482 --> 00:24:19.666
That punk.

00:24:21.677 --> 00:24:23.212
Come back here!

00:24:23.654 --> 00:24:24.672
Hey.

00:24:27.658 --> 00:24:30.519
Have you lost your mind? Give them back.

00:24:30.602 --> 00:24:32.513
- Sorry. I'll watch them and return them.
- Give them.

00:24:32.596 --> 00:24:34.056
- Why would you watch them?
- Please.

00:24:34.139 --> 00:24:35.891
- Give them back.
- I honestly have to--

00:24:37.059 --> 00:24:38.970
- I'm sorry.
- Why would you watch them?

00:24:39.053 --> 00:24:40.312
Give them back to me.

00:24:40.613 --> 00:24:42.273
- Give it.
- Please let me watch it.

00:24:42.356 --> 00:24:43.816
- Give them back now.
- Hang on.

00:24:44.008 --> 00:24:45.693
- Just a second.
- What are you guys doing?

00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:50.781
Are you just coming back home?

00:24:51.265 --> 00:24:53.409
Well, I'm going to...

00:24:54.201 --> 00:24:55.577
return these videotapes.

00:24:56.312 --> 00:24:58.312
Punk.

00:24:59.581 --> 00:25:01.291
MADAM TAURUS CHEATS
RESTRICTED: AGES 19 AND OVER ONLY

00:25:07.464 --> 00:25:08.632
Dad.

00:25:17.141 --> 00:25:19.352
You're too young for this stuff.

00:25:29.386 --> 00:25:30.570
Jun-seok.

00:25:31.914 --> 00:25:33.115
Yes?

00:25:34.158 --> 00:25:35.701
A guy asked me to be his girlfriend today.

00:25:37.161 --> 00:25:39.161
Oh, I see.

00:25:41.623 --> 00:25:42.707
And?

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:47.210
Are you seeing someone right now?

00:25:51.433 --> 00:25:53.301
There's someone I'm waiting for.

00:25:57.723 --> 00:25:59.083
I said no.

00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:05.355
You did?

00:26:09.802 --> 00:26:10.820
When should we

00:26:11.612 --> 00:26:12.947
go to Seokmo Island?

00:26:15.699 --> 00:26:16.909
When you're free.

00:26:17.543 --> 00:26:18.494
What?

00:26:19.119 --> 00:26:20.621
When you want to go.

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:22.414
That's when we'll go.

00:26:30.631 --> 00:26:32.133
Should we have a beer?

00:26:34.051 --> 00:26:35.052
Sure.

00:26:35.973 --> 00:26:36.973
Let's go.

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.225
- Do you have cold beer?
- I do.

00:26:50.818 --> 00:26:52.370
- Ju-yeon.
- Yes?

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.698
What will you do
if you run into that older guy at school?

00:27:00.994 --> 00:27:02.994
You accepted a blind date
without even considering that?

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.480
It wasn't a blind date.

00:27:05.682 --> 00:27:07.959
He just came without asking.

00:27:09.453 --> 00:27:11.088
Gosh.

00:27:30.065 --> 00:27:31.316
- Hey.
- What?

00:27:31.608 --> 00:27:32.734
You know,

00:27:33.302 --> 00:27:35.070
after we go to Seokmo island...

00:27:36.472 --> 00:27:37.573
After that,

00:27:37.806 --> 00:27:40.867
if we have time...

00:27:41.435 --> 00:27:44.496
If we have time, I mean. During vacation,

00:27:47.249 --> 00:27:49.460
should we go to Jeju Island together?

00:27:52.421 --> 00:27:53.547
Jeju Island?

00:27:54.214 --> 00:27:55.424
Yes.

00:27:56.675 --> 00:27:58.343
I've always wanted to go to Jeju Island.

00:28:04.233 --> 00:28:05.351
Really?

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:14.359
Then, we should visit all the islands.

00:28:16.053 --> 00:28:18.053
- Which islands?
- There are lots.

00:28:18.806 --> 00:28:20.449
Phuket, Bali,

00:28:21.016 --> 00:28:22.117
Hawaii,

00:28:23.227 --> 00:28:24.912
Australia,

00:28:25.395 --> 00:28:26.580
and...

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:29.499
Anyway, all those islands.
We'll visit them together.

00:28:29.708 --> 00:28:31.001
I'd love that.

00:28:31.919 --> 00:28:34.922
But would we have enough time
to visit all of them?

00:28:36.298 --> 00:28:39.402
We can continue to visit different ones.

00:28:39.486 --> 00:28:41.562
We've got time. We'll grow old with time.

00:28:42.079 --> 00:28:46.100
We can go every time we get a chance
until the day we die.

00:28:47.434 --> 00:28:48.852
- Until the day we die?
- Yes.

00:28:49.236 --> 00:28:50.420
Well...

00:28:52.923 --> 00:28:54.608
- But
- Yes?

00:28:55.075 --> 00:28:58.236
what if I get a new boyfriend
in the meantime?

00:29:00.514 --> 00:29:01.740
Oh, you're right.

00:29:13.102 --> 00:29:14.245
What?

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:16.088
I don't know.

00:29:16.797 --> 00:29:18.382
Every time I look at you,

00:29:19.158 --> 00:29:21.341
I just want to hit you and pinch you,

00:29:21.425 --> 00:29:23.219
and I just can't stand you.

00:29:24.813 --> 00:29:26.431
You frustrate me so much.

00:29:32.613 --> 00:29:33.813
I'm speechless.

00:29:42.072 --> 00:29:43.699
- Here.
- Oh,

00:29:44.533 --> 00:29:45.826
thanks.

00:30:06.305 --> 00:30:07.598
Did you know...

00:30:08.473 --> 00:30:11.142
that this was our first time
seeing each other

00:30:12.144 --> 00:30:13.479
outside of the club?

00:30:14.896 --> 00:30:17.273
It felt like we've met each other
so often.

00:30:17.733 --> 00:30:19.065
How can this be?

00:30:19.609 --> 00:30:21.027
It's so funny.

00:30:36.443 --> 00:30:37.544
I thought...

00:30:38.795 --> 00:30:41.673
you and I had so many things in common.

00:30:44.217 --> 00:30:45.552
I guess that's why I was attracted to you.

00:30:46.495 --> 00:30:49.181
I thought, "She's cool like me."

00:30:50.098 --> 00:30:51.683
And I like it cool.

00:30:54.102 --> 00:30:55.562
But it turns out

00:30:56.438 --> 00:30:57.481
I was wrong.

00:30:59.232 --> 00:31:00.525
I was mistaken.

00:31:04.429 --> 00:31:05.864
I'm not that cool.

00:31:07.783 --> 00:31:09.410
You're the cool one,

00:31:10.535 --> 00:31:11.995
and I'm not cool at all.

00:31:14.748 --> 00:31:15.832
No.

00:31:17.417 --> 00:31:18.710
I can't be cool about it anymore.

00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:22.714
It took me so long to realize that.

00:31:27.177 --> 00:31:28.679
I've been acting so cool until now,

00:31:30.614 --> 00:31:31.640
and I'm sorry.

00:31:39.656 --> 00:31:41.858
I'm not that cool either.

00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:46.946
I like to dance,

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.615
I like going to clubs,

00:31:49.741 --> 00:31:51.242
and I love having fun.

00:31:52.978 --> 00:31:54.037
But

00:31:55.539 --> 00:31:58.498
people tell me to act like how I look.

00:31:59.876 --> 00:32:01.544
They tell me I don't belong there.

00:32:04.881 --> 00:32:06.257
That must be why

00:32:06.742 --> 00:32:08.635
I tried to be cool about it.

00:32:16.977 --> 00:32:18.270
Also,

00:32:19.521 --> 00:32:20.772
actually,

00:32:23.483 --> 00:32:25.777
I'm more into guys
like Jun-seok, your friend.

00:32:31.516 --> 00:32:32.617
What?

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:35.120
I'm into good-looking guys.

00:32:35.645 --> 00:32:37.645
I'm super picky about a guy's face.

00:32:41.418 --> 00:32:44.129
See? You don't know me that well.

00:32:47.199 --> 00:32:48.592
Well,

00:32:49.242 --> 00:32:50.969
are Jun-seok and I that different?

00:32:53.763 --> 00:32:57.083
Anyway, how are we exactly the same?
We're both picky about looks.

00:32:57.334 --> 00:32:59.334
Gosh. Unbelievable.

00:32:59.644 --> 00:33:03.481
But should I tell you this or not?

00:33:04.566 --> 00:33:05.993
- Do you want to know?
- What is it?

00:33:06.136 --> 00:33:08.404
No. Should I tell you or not?

00:33:08.804 --> 00:33:09.863
What is it about?

00:33:10.864 --> 00:33:12.282
About Jun-seok,

00:33:13.108 --> 00:33:14.242
he really...

00:33:14.768 --> 00:33:17.120
Gosh. He never washes.

00:33:17.417 --> 00:33:20.774
He rarely washes his clothes
or takes a shower, so he always smells.

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:23.110
You can't be into a guy like him.

00:33:23.193 --> 00:33:24.628
Gosh.

00:33:25.278 --> 00:33:27.278
He was so handsome
that I didn't even know he smelled bad.

00:33:38.959 --> 00:33:43.730
We regret to inform you that we will not
be able to move forward with you

00:33:44.147 --> 00:33:45.315
at this time.

00:34:02.683 --> 00:34:05.777
RÉSUMÉ

00:34:11.883 --> 00:34:16.871
HANKOOK UNIVERSITY LIBRARY

00:34:45.375 --> 00:34:46.968
The number you've dialed is not available.

00:34:47.051 --> 00:34:48.253
After the beep...

00:34:56.428 --> 00:34:58.930
Slow down there.

00:35:07.314 --> 00:35:08.440
So,

00:35:08.924 --> 00:35:11.944
you two haven't seen each other
in two weeks?

00:35:13.361 --> 00:35:15.488
What on earth is he up to?

00:35:18.533 --> 00:35:20.910
I have no clue.

00:35:24.523 --> 00:35:26.333
I don't know what he's up to.

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:30.045
He's young.

00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:33.256
You'll have to understand.

00:35:34.282 --> 00:35:35.675
I know that.

00:35:38.119 --> 00:35:40.012
It's not that I don't understand him.

00:35:40.147 --> 00:35:41.765
It's not that.

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.228
But...

00:35:48.588 --> 00:35:51.274
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

00:36:01.134 --> 00:36:02.202
Stop.

00:36:02.486 --> 00:36:04.871
- Give it.
- I'll pour it for you.

00:37:25.977 --> 00:37:28.204
- Hey.
- Min-gi.

00:38:07.352 --> 00:38:08.787
Have you been well?

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:14.584
Yes.

00:38:17.921 --> 00:38:19.172
I've been well.

00:38:20.448 --> 00:38:22.467
What happened to your arm?

00:38:24.953 --> 00:38:27.455
I must have gotten a scratch.

00:38:36.131 --> 00:38:37.858
Have you been well?

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:41.528
Yes.

00:38:44.639 --> 00:38:46.240
It's the same every day.

00:38:47.584 --> 00:38:48.618
I've been...

00:38:49.244 --> 00:38:51.329
writing résumés, taking classes,

00:38:52.063 --> 00:38:53.456
and working at the coffee shop.

00:38:57.193 --> 00:38:58.544
It's been the same.

00:39:03.016 --> 00:39:04.050
I see.

00:39:27.724 --> 00:39:28.867
Min-gi.

00:39:29.784 --> 00:39:30.994
Yes?

00:39:38.893 --> 00:39:41.087
Should we go outside and take a walk?

00:39:42.739 --> 00:39:44.257
Sure. I'd like that.

00:39:46.509 --> 00:39:47.760
Let's go.

00:40:09.474 --> 00:40:10.658
Are you all right?

00:40:15.997 --> 00:40:18.666
Why is he driving so fast
in this narrow alley?

00:40:21.319 --> 00:40:25.214
PHOTO BOOTH

00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:36.684
Let's take photo stickers.

00:40:38.394 --> 00:40:39.478
Come on.

00:40:40.245 --> 00:40:43.114
PHOTO BOOTH

00:40:45.077 --> 00:40:46.536
PAYMENT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED
PHOTO SHOOT WILL BEGIN SHORTLY

00:40:49.931 --> 00:40:51.074
Here it goes.

00:40:51.585 --> 00:40:52.784
You can look at this.

00:41:11.753 --> 00:41:12.887
We got them.

00:41:17.433 --> 00:41:18.601
Check this out.

00:41:21.396 --> 00:41:22.898
- They look good, right?
- Yes.

00:41:25.233 --> 00:41:26.525
Should we step out?

00:41:27.235 --> 00:41:29.279
Sure. Let's go.

00:41:55.221 --> 00:41:57.221
Here. Eat this.

00:41:59.167 --> 00:42:02.937
Grilling it is tougher than it looks.
How come they keep burning?

00:42:10.219 --> 00:42:12.029
- Min-gi.
- Yes?

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:18.494
Let's...

00:42:21.205 --> 00:42:22.581
break up.

00:42:25.126 --> 00:42:26.210
What?

00:42:28.629 --> 00:42:29.664
What...

00:42:30.198 --> 00:42:31.800
What do you mean?

00:42:36.929 --> 00:42:37.930
Seol-ha.

00:42:43.394 --> 00:42:44.687
Seol-ha.

00:42:45.438 --> 00:42:48.191
Seol-ha. Wait.

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:50.151
Seol-ha.

00:42:51.027 --> 00:42:52.237
Seol-ha?

00:42:52.637 --> 00:42:54.637
Stop. What's the matter?

00:42:56.324 --> 00:42:57.534
What is it?

00:42:59.302 --> 00:43:03.789
Is it because I burned all the meat?

00:43:05.091 --> 00:43:08.669
You need to tell me so I know.

00:43:16.094 --> 00:43:18.221
- I...
- Yes.

00:43:24.018 --> 00:43:25.186
don't think...

00:43:26.871 --> 00:43:28.815
I love you anymore.

00:43:58.019 --> 00:43:59.429
No.

00:44:00.304 --> 00:44:01.764
If you're going to break up,

00:44:03.599 --> 00:44:04.850
break up on your own.

00:44:49.996 --> 00:44:52.548

00:45:02.867 --> 00:45:04.327
- Kim Min-gyeong.
- Here.

00:45:04.727 --> 00:45:06.203
- Kim Yong-jun.
- Here.

00:45:06.854 --> 00:45:08.164
- Kim Da-hui?
- Yes.

00:45:08.731 --> 00:45:10.207
- Noh Jun-seok.
- Here.

00:45:10.917 --> 00:45:12.252
- Baek Seung-heon.
- Yes.

00:45:13.069 --> 00:45:14.671
- Seo Min-gi.
- Here!

00:45:15.296 --> 00:45:16.798
- Lee Ga-eun.
- Yes.

00:45:17.298 --> 00:45:18.925
- Lee Gwang-jae.
- Here.

00:45:21.427 --> 00:45:23.596
It certainly is boring without the gang.

00:45:25.848 --> 00:45:27.848
Hey, what did

00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:29.977
Min-gi say when you called him?

00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:33.689
No idea. He asked me to answer
roll call for him until this week.

00:45:35.066 --> 00:45:36.818
I thought he was done with Seol-ha.

00:45:37.501 --> 00:45:39.153
He says he's not done.

00:45:39.804 --> 00:45:42.824
Man. What's he going to do
if he's not done with her?

00:45:44.533 --> 00:45:46.160
Do you know what an earthbound spirit is?

00:45:48.955 --> 00:45:50.748
- Of course.
- What is it?

00:45:51.232 --> 00:45:54.168
Isn't it someone who goes
on a business trip to the countryside?

00:45:55.778 --> 00:45:56.962
Idiot.

00:45:57.147 --> 00:46:00.800
When a person dies in a car crash
or any other accident,

00:46:00.975 --> 00:46:03.386
it's so sudden that the person isn't aware
that they're dead.

00:46:03.844 --> 00:46:05.387
So, they just hover around the same place.

00:46:05.763 --> 00:46:06.847
That's an earthbound spirit.

00:46:07.723 --> 00:46:10.601
Min-gi was dumped out of nowhere.
He's become an earthbound spirit.

00:46:11.444 --> 00:46:13.688
Gosh. I feel bad for him.

00:46:15.273 --> 00:46:16.716
There's nothing we can do.

00:46:16.799 --> 00:46:19.611
We only need to leave him alone
until he realizes he's dead.

00:46:22.113 --> 00:46:23.364
What a fool.

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:27.570
- Go Eun-taek?
- That's me.

00:46:27.667 --> 00:46:28.773
You're a former?

00:46:28.857 --> 00:46:29.912
- Yes.
- Your total is 170 dollars.

00:46:29.996 --> 00:46:30.828
Thank you.

00:46:30.912 --> 00:46:32.029
- Name?
- I'm Shin Seong-sik.

00:46:32.112 --> 00:46:33.090
- Shin Seong-sik.
- Yes.

00:46:33.173 --> 00:46:34.466
- Were you the welder?
- Yes.

00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:36.634
- That's 150 dollars for him.
- Thank you.

00:46:37.236 --> 00:46:39.046
- Name?
- Seo Min-gi.

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:40.548
Seo Min-gi?

00:46:40.717 --> 00:46:42.450
Odd-job worker. It's 37 dollars.

00:46:43.835 --> 00:46:44.953
- Thank you.
- Next.

00:46:45.036 --> 00:46:46.204
- Seo Sang-yeop?
- Waterproofing.

00:46:46.287 --> 00:46:47.388
- Waterproofing?
- Yes.

00:47:07.692 --> 00:47:10.162
L'ATELIER DE MONET

00:47:14.647 --> 00:47:15.647
Seol-ha.

00:47:34.685 --> 00:47:35.811
Have you been well?

00:47:36.963 --> 00:47:38.106
Yes.

00:47:41.817 --> 00:47:42.985
Take this.

00:47:45.404 --> 00:47:46.530
What's this?

00:47:47.448 --> 00:47:49.575
It's your birthday gift.

00:47:50.034 --> 00:47:51.702
I'm sorry that it's so late.

00:48:00.611 --> 00:48:02.611
- Min-gi.
- I know.

00:48:07.451 --> 00:48:09.451
I understand now.

00:48:20.673 --> 00:48:23.609
Then, take it back.

00:48:27.446 --> 00:48:30.574
Let me give you something too.

00:48:45.448 --> 00:48:46.591
I'll get going.

00:48:49.969 --> 00:48:51.053
Okay.

00:48:52.246 --> 00:48:53.556
Goodbye.

00:49:05.151 --> 00:49:06.277
Min-gi!

00:49:46.342 --> 00:49:47.860
It's not coming off that easily.

00:49:58.379 --> 00:49:59.663
That's fine.

00:50:56.996 --> 00:50:58.996
- On your three.
- Okay.

00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:00.850
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

00:51:00.933 --> 00:51:01.976
Log in.

00:51:02.851 --> 00:51:05.645
I have an Overlord on our three.

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:10.693
I'm ready to go.

00:51:10.776 --> 00:51:11.902
- Already?
- Yes.

00:51:12.319 --> 00:51:13.737
Can you help me out?

00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:15.280
- I'm on my way.
- Hurry.

00:51:30.588 --> 00:51:32.340
Wait. Watch out for that one.

00:54:26.722 --> 00:54:27.848
Hello?

00:54:29.249 --> 00:54:30.559
Yes.

00:54:33.445 --> 00:54:34.688
That's me.

00:54:37.733 --> 00:54:38.776
Oh,

00:54:39.310 --> 00:54:40.444
I passed?

00:54:43.739 --> 00:54:47.034
Okay. Yes, thank you.

00:54:48.619 --> 00:54:52.081
Yes. I understand. Thank you very much.

00:54:55.417 --> 00:54:56.460
What do I do?

00:54:56.752 --> 00:54:58.379
- You got in?
- Yes.

00:54:59.046 --> 00:55:00.631
- You're in?
- Yes.

00:55:01.865 --> 00:55:03.383
Oh, my gosh.

00:55:03.575 --> 00:55:06.303
Good for you. Congratulations.

00:55:06.887 --> 00:55:08.887
I told you they'd hire you.

00:55:09.348 --> 00:55:12.059
I'm so proud of you!

00:55:13.268 --> 00:55:16.146
Great job. You've worked hard for so long.

THE 8TH "GUARDIANS OF OUR LAND"
15KM SHORT MARATHON

00:57:09.117 --> 00:57:10.301
Water.

00:57:10.994 --> 00:57:13.221
- Do you hear that too?
- Hey!

00:57:13.805 --> 00:57:15.982
- Water!
- What's going on?

00:57:19.044 --> 00:57:21.480
Water. Bring me water!

00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:24.591
- What did you say?
- Bring me water!

00:57:24.674 --> 00:57:27.444
Water? Gosh.

00:57:32.282 --> 00:57:33.617
Drink up.

00:57:37.688 --> 00:57:38.789
Is that enough water?

00:57:39.273 --> 00:57:40.749
- Jeez.
- Isn't it tough?

00:57:42.734 --> 00:57:44.169
Of course, it's tough.

00:57:46.889 --> 00:57:49.591
- Don't your feet hurt?
- They hurt so badly.

00:57:50.092 --> 00:57:51.885
Why are you training for a marathon
all of a sudden?

00:57:56.832 --> 00:57:58.350
Haven't you ever felt that way?

00:57:59.209 --> 00:58:02.646
Sometimes, you just want to run.

00:58:09.136 --> 00:58:10.779
You won't understand.

00:58:15.117 --> 00:58:16.619
You won't understand.

00:58:19.271 --> 00:58:21.331
You just want to run sometimes.

00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:27.796
Whatever.

00:58:29.339 --> 00:58:32.092
You're soaked in sweat. Get a shower.

00:58:37.222 --> 00:58:38.807
- Are you all warmed up now?
- Yes.

00:58:38.890 --> 00:58:40.559
Min-gi, there's a cash prize
for 1st to 3rd places.

00:58:40.767 --> 00:58:43.019
If I place third and win a cash prize,

00:58:43.102 --> 00:58:44.838
- we're splitting it even, okay?
- Seriously?

00:58:44.922 --> 00:58:46.941
- And we drink tonight with that?
- We will.

00:58:47.607 --> 00:58:49.259
- Don't overwork yourself. Aim for third.
- Okay.

00:58:49.342 --> 00:58:52.480
- You're ready for this.
- I might be too fast. Try to catch up.

00:58:52.564 --> 00:58:53.613
- Okay!
- Okay.

00:58:53.696 --> 00:58:55.114
- Here I go.
- You've got this!

00:58:55.198 --> 00:58:57.575
- Go, Min-gi!
- Go!

00:58:58.685 --> 00:59:00.286
What if he places first?

00:59:00.687 --> 00:59:03.289
- From what I can tell, he totally could.
- Really?

The 8th "Guardians of Our Land"
15km Short Marathon

00:59:07.586 --> 00:59:09.421
- Aim for third place!
- will begin shortly.

00:59:09.504 --> 00:59:12.258
- You can do it!
- Please get out of their way.

00:59:13.008 --> 00:59:15.010
In 1, 2, 3.

00:59:19.683 --> 00:59:21.288
He might actually place first!

00:59:21.616 --> 00:59:22.679
Run, Min-gi!

00:59:34.738 --> 00:59:36.198
I only wanted to run fast,

00:59:37.057 --> 00:59:38.700
like everyone else.

00:59:39.726 --> 00:59:41.786
But my steps were always tangled,

00:59:42.412 --> 00:59:44.039
my legs tripped over each other,
and I fell.

00:59:45.107 --> 00:59:48.710
Then, I used the fall as an excuse
not to finish the race.

00:59:49.377 --> 00:59:50.628
That was always

00:59:51.213 --> 00:59:52.548
as far as I got.

00:59:53.365 --> 00:59:54.716
Today,

00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:57.844
I will run at a pace I can handle.

00:59:59.096 --> 01:00:02.224
I will run with the stride that is mine.

01:00:03.683 --> 01:00:05.018
What matters is

01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:07.020
that I finish the race.

01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:08.772
Korean literature major?

01:00:17.014 --> 01:00:18.699
The fatigue you gave me

01:00:19.801 --> 01:00:21.117
Wakes me up

01:00:22.202 --> 01:00:24.922
SEOL-HA, THE TRUTH IS... I LIKE YOU

01:00:26.848 --> 01:00:28.567
Did you like me or not?

01:00:28.834 --> 01:00:30.044
I never thought about you that way.

01:00:30.569 --> 01:00:31.879
Bitch.

01:00:33.822 --> 01:00:35.507
Only when I cross that finish line

01:00:36.408 --> 01:00:38.844
will I truly understand.

01:00:39.928 --> 01:00:41.721
Where my limits lie.

01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:43.723
Where my rock bottom is.

01:00:45.083 --> 01:00:47.143
Today, I will come to face
with that bottom.

01:00:48.395 --> 01:00:49.855
And tomorrow, I will push off from it

01:00:50.672 --> 01:00:53.024
- and rise higher.
- And told him you had a new boyfriend!

01:00:53.608 --> 01:00:56.260
Don't go! Seol-ha, please!

01:00:56.344 --> 01:00:59.072
It's just that I'm too frustrated!

01:00:59.222 --> 01:01:00.740
You laughed only when you got mine!

01:01:01.199 --> 01:01:03.076
- I'll get you a proper gift!
- I said it was fine!

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:04.327
Min-gi!

01:01:04.410 --> 01:01:06.996
Let me give you something too.

01:01:17.132 --> 01:01:19.009
- Keep running!
- You've got this!

01:01:19.092 --> 01:01:20.260
You can do it!

01:01:40.488 --> 01:01:42.448
- Min-gi!
- Min-gi!

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:43.492
What?

01:01:43.575 --> 01:01:44.584
- Who is that?
- He wasn't wearing green.

01:01:44.667 --> 01:01:46.160
- He had a white shirt.
- White shirt.

01:01:46.243 --> 01:01:48.211
Wait. There he is.

01:01:48.294 --> 01:01:50.149
- That's not him.
- No, he's wearing white, dude.

01:01:50.565 --> 01:01:52.458
- Isn't that him? Over there.
- What?

01:01:52.541 --> 01:01:54.460
- That must be him.
- There he comes.

01:01:54.543 --> 01:01:56.629
- Min-gi!
- Min-gi, run harder!

01:01:56.712 --> 01:01:57.839
Run!

01:02:00.075 --> 01:02:01.343
That's not Min-gi.

01:02:17.451 --> 01:02:18.819
What's taking him so long?

01:02:19.866 --> 01:02:22.126
THE 8TH "GUARDIANS OF OUR LAND"
15KM SHORT MARATHON

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:25.325
- I would have walked here faster.
- He must be crawling, then.

01:03:01.318 --> 01:03:02.318
Cramp!

01:03:12.422 --> 01:03:13.832
You said he might place first.

01:03:15.717 --> 01:03:17.335
I said third.

01:03:18.028 --> 01:03:19.588
Third to last, you mean.

01:03:47.682 --> 01:03:49.993
- He couldn't have died, could he?
- Come on.

01:03:55.882 --> 01:03:57.166
Let's go and find him.

01:03:59.986 --> 01:04:01.212
- Hang on tight.
- Okay.

01:04:02.097 --> 01:04:03.173
Let's go. Where is he?

01:04:11.623 --> 01:04:12.724
Is that him?

01:04:12.916 --> 01:04:14.976
Hey. Isn't that Min-gi?

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:17.687
Oh, gosh.

01:04:17.770 --> 01:04:19.397
I was so sure he was wearing green.

01:05:39.602 --> 01:05:40.978
Didn't I tell you?

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:44.065
Oh, hi.

01:05:44.716 --> 01:05:45.900
Hey, Min-gi!

01:05:53.908 --> 01:05:55.201
Yes, this happened.

01:05:58.705 --> 01:06:00.916
Call me. Let's have a meal someday.

01:06:01.332 --> 01:06:03.834
Call me. Bye.

01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:29.360
That's my son.

01:06:31.362 --> 01:06:32.488
He's handsome, isn't he?

01:06:32.806 --> 01:06:33.949
Sure.

01:06:58.873 --> 01:07:02.310
Even if the world turns its back on you

01:07:02.393 --> 01:07:06.355
I will stand by your side

01:07:06.731 --> 01:07:10.610
In this harsh world of mine

01:07:10.693 --> 01:07:14.405
My love for you will never fade

01:07:14.488 --> 01:07:17.825
I won't regret a thing

01:07:17.908 --> 01:07:22.080
Even if I fall, tired and broken

01:07:22.163 --> 01:07:24.065
- Just stay
- You, the one in jeans.

01:07:24.148 --> 01:07:26.148
- By my side, I--
- Jeans!

01:07:26.609 --> 01:07:27.960
No ad-libbing.

01:07:28.753 --> 01:07:31.130
Right. Sorry about that.

01:07:31.239 --> 01:07:33.550
I apologize.

01:07:34.281 --> 01:07:36.744
Gosh, why are there so many weeds?

01:07:43.918 --> 01:07:45.770
Where are they coming from?

01:07:45.853 --> 01:07:47.313
Let's see.

01:08:05.724 --> 01:08:06.958
Stay quiet.

01:08:08.326 --> 01:08:11.379
No, I'm sorry. Please. I have to go.

01:08:12.597 --> 01:08:14.132
Okay. Bye.

01:08:16.034 --> 01:08:17.260
What was that?

01:08:18.136 --> 01:08:19.596
What? Ju-yeon.

01:08:20.163 --> 01:08:21.890
Where are you going? It's getting late.

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:25.309
I was coming home.

01:08:25.852 --> 01:08:29.147
You were just taking a shower inside.
When did you have time to go out?

01:08:29.714 --> 01:08:31.010
No, I just came back home.

01:08:31.724 --> 01:08:32.907
Is that so?

01:08:33.742 --> 01:08:36.404
Then, get inside and wash up.
Get ready for dinner.

01:08:37.939 --> 01:08:39.315
- You're dead.
- Get inside.

01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:43.370
Where did this come from?

01:08:54.072 --> 01:08:56.299
- Hello?
- It's me.

01:08:56.799 --> 01:08:57.925
Min-gi.

01:08:58.284 --> 01:09:00.553
Oh, hey.

01:09:01.179 --> 01:09:02.430
I'm...

01:09:03.081 --> 01:09:04.766
leaving for boot camp now.

01:09:05.083 --> 01:09:07.185
Oh, I see.

01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:09.187
Get back safely.

01:09:09.771 --> 01:09:12.524
- Are you at work?
- Yes, I'm at work.

01:09:13.258 --> 01:09:15.151
How's work?

01:09:16.903 --> 01:09:18.613
It's tough, isn't it?

01:09:21.641 --> 01:09:22.742
Hello?

01:09:23.576 --> 01:09:24.786
Yes.

01:09:27.297 --> 01:09:28.623
Seol-ha.

01:09:35.613 --> 01:09:38.215
Thank you.

01:09:39.217 --> 01:09:40.552
For what?

01:09:43.388 --> 01:09:45.557
For teaching me what love is.

01:09:49.068 --> 01:09:50.269
And...

01:09:53.172 --> 01:09:55.172
for the fact that you were the one

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:57.568
who taught me that.

01:09:59.345 --> 01:10:01.864
- Thank you so much.
- I just finished it.

01:10:02.949 --> 01:10:06.186
Min-gi, I'm really busy right now.
I have to hang up. Sorry.

01:10:06.455 --> 01:10:08.329
Don't get hurt while you're there, okay?

01:10:11.249 --> 01:10:12.709
But I was sure I looked it up.
