00:15:17.735 --> 00:15:19.983
Hello, I'm Hao, and I'm from China.

00:15:19.984 --> 00:15:23.284
My Korean name is Nam Hyun-soo
but Hao is just easier.

00:15:23.285 --> 00:15:24.910
Just call me Hao.

00:15:24.911 --> 00:15:27.542
Are you really Chinese?

00:15:28.253 --> 00:15:29.963
You're super good at Korean.

00:15:31.652 --> 00:15:33.370
Yes, I'm really from China.

00:15:33.371 --> 00:15:35.216
I've always wanted to come to Korea.

00:15:35.217 --> 00:15:37.200
I'm happy to meet you guys.

00:15:38.656 --> 00:15:40.149
I hope we can get along.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:45.635
My little brother, my friends
and even Bitna, the girl I had a crush on.

00:15:47.421 --> 00:15:49.861
He took away everything I care about.

00:15:58.382 --> 00:16:02.867
Hyun-gyu, take care of your brother
so he doesn't have a hard time.

00:16:04.566 --> 00:16:06.479
He doesn't say so

00:16:07.355 --> 00:16:09.771
but he's probably having a hard time
at home and at school.

00:16:12.511 --> 00:16:13.723
Why should I?

00:16:16.945 --> 00:16:18.511
Think about how rough Hyun-soo has it.

00:16:18.512 --> 00:16:21.029
He's all alone in a new place
and he lost his mother.

00:16:23.128 --> 00:16:24.813
You don't see me, do you?

00:16:26.765 --> 00:16:27.860
What?

00:16:28.468 --> 00:16:30.598
Do you even know how I feel right now?

00:16:30.946 --> 00:16:32.141
For me

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:35.348
Every day is like hell because I'm scared
people will find out my brother is someone

00:16:35.349 --> 00:16:37.012
you had with another woman!

00:16:38.079 --> 00:16:39.729
Why do I need to be
understanding of your son?

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:42.968
Why are you forcing me to understand
that jerk who has nothing to do with me?

00:16:57.823 --> 00:16:59.805
- Hey, Nam Hyun-gyu.
- Get lost.

00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:03.502
Is that all you ever
have to say to me? Huh?

00:17:05.682 --> 00:17:06.912
Do you want to play a round?

00:17:08.302 --> 00:17:09.498
Or not.

00:17:10.166 --> 00:17:11.837
If I win, transfer to a new school.

00:17:17.707 --> 00:17:19.055
What if I win?

00:17:20.209 --> 00:17:21.689
Call me your brother.

00:17:25.467 --> 00:17:27.476
- Do you think I'll lose?
- You never know.

00:17:29.137 --> 00:17:31.686
Whoever gets three points first wins.

00:18:42.651 --> 00:18:44.194
I won.

00:18:46.754 --> 00:18:48.846
Go ahead, call me your brother.

00:18:49.479 --> 00:18:50.836
Let's play another round.

00:18:51.523 --> 00:18:53.605
You lost.
Why won't you accept it?

00:18:55.855 --> 00:18:57.851
Hey, there's something called
"Say touché" in fencing.

00:18:57.852 --> 00:18:59.127
Basically, it means
you accept your own defeat...

00:18:59.128 --> 00:19:00.491
What do you think you're doing?

00:19:02.506 --> 00:19:04.801
Look up what touché means later.

00:19:05.474 --> 00:19:07.687
And you don't have to
call me your brother.

00:19:08.169 --> 00:19:10.531
Just stop giving mom a hard time.

00:19:11.086 --> 00:19:12.190
Hey.

00:19:13.625 --> 00:19:15.331
Why are you calling my mom your mom?

00:19:18.617 --> 00:19:21.628
You're the one
giving mom a hard time, not me.

00:19:53.485 --> 00:19:58.121
Your teacher called me today.

00:20:01.232 --> 00:20:04.863
She said Hyun-gyu turned in
a blank math midterm.

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:08.687
Hyun-gyu did?

00:20:11.972 --> 00:20:13.865
My poor Hyun-gyu.

00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:18.526
Hao.

00:20:19.222 --> 00:20:20.738
No, Hyun-soo.

00:20:24.457 --> 00:20:28.547
Could you transfer

00:20:29.273 --> 00:20:33.262
to a school with a dorm?

00:20:46.435 --> 00:20:48.668
He's your little brother.

00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:59.826
Please...

00:21:18.454 --> 00:21:20.652
In fencing
there's a term called "touché."

00:21:20.653 --> 00:21:23.557
It’s shouted when an attack
is successful and scores a point.

00:21:23.558 --> 00:21:26.241
The attacker doesn't shout it
the person who's been hit does.

00:21:26.489 --> 00:21:28.332
Fencing is such a sensitive sport

00:21:28.333 --> 00:21:31.032
that even the attacker
might not be sure if they landed the hit.

00:21:31.358 --> 00:21:33.181
However, the person who's been hit knows

00:21:33.182 --> 00:21:35.412
so before there were scoring machines

00:21:35.413 --> 00:21:37.687
the person who got hit
would shout "touché."

00:21:37.688 --> 00:21:38.884
What makes fencing so impressive

00:21:38.885 --> 00:21:42.316
is the sport's mentality
of acknowledging your own defeat.

00:21:46.491 --> 00:21:49.160
Who is he to teach me? Annoying jerk.

00:22:02.729 --> 00:22:04.238
Wow, Hyun-gyu.

00:22:05.069 --> 00:22:06.545
Hey, when'd you get here?

00:22:06.546 --> 00:22:08.287
You've gotten much better.

00:22:08.288 --> 00:22:09.680
You're good enough to do a show.

00:22:09.681 --> 00:22:12.527
- No, I'm not that good.
- Of course you are.

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:14.653
Give it a try.

00:22:15.383 --> 00:22:16.840
Did you see Four Mix?

00:22:16.841 --> 00:22:18.406
- Gosh, they're so good looking.
- So good looking.

00:22:18.407 --> 00:22:19.707
I know, right? They're insane!

00:22:19.708 --> 00:22:20.834
The song is good too.

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:27.447
Is that who you have a crush on?

00:22:28.658 --> 00:22:29.687
Yeah.

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:33.141
She is damn pretty.

00:22:33.142 --> 00:22:34.281
It's not gonna be easy.

00:22:35.262 --> 00:22:37.290
I told you, she's a goddess.

00:22:38.267 --> 00:22:40.584
But when she smiles, she's super cute

00:22:40.922 --> 00:22:42.783
and when she talks, she's bubbly.

00:22:44.124 --> 00:22:46.035
Looking at her makes me happy.

00:22:49.247 --> 00:22:52.123
Man, I feel bad for you.

00:22:53.196 --> 00:22:55.947
So when are you gonna tell her?

00:22:56.593 --> 00:22:58.051
Are you going to
keep this a crush forever?

00:22:58.973 --> 00:23:01.363
I thought you liked her
since school started.

00:23:02.343 --> 00:23:04.249
I don't have enough courage yet.

00:23:04.806 --> 00:23:07.268
Oh, you guys are having
a school festival, right?

00:23:07.746 --> 00:23:09.574
In my case

00:23:09.745 --> 00:23:14.028
I spun some tracks at the festival
and my popularity went through the roof.

00:23:15.897 --> 00:23:17.320
You should give it a try.
You never know

00:23:17.321 --> 00:23:19.857
if she might fall for you
after seeing you DJ.

00:23:26.775 --> 00:23:28.590
What's wrong with him?

00:23:28.967 --> 00:23:31.119
Why is he so cool?

00:23:31.575 --> 00:23:34.141
Wow, Nam Hyun-gyu's so cool!

00:23:36.815 --> 00:23:40.409
Think of this as your school festival

00:23:40.923 --> 00:23:42.091
and give it a go.

00:23:54.286 --> 00:23:55.310
There you go.

00:23:59.495 --> 00:24:00.837
He's so handsome.

00:24:01.749 --> 00:24:03.640
- So handsome.
- I know, right?

00:24:03.641 --> 00:24:05.118
It's crazy.

00:24:07.162 --> 00:24:09.513
- He was so cool.
- I know, right?

00:24:10.774 --> 00:24:12.320
Isn't that Hao?

00:24:12.604 --> 00:24:15.589
- Why does he look so down?
- I know, right?

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:18.094
Where did his friends go?

00:24:18.095 --> 00:24:20.046
Hey, you guys should go first.

00:24:22.872 --> 00:24:24.658
Good luck. Let's go.

00:24:24.659 --> 00:24:26.058
What? Why?

00:24:26.059 --> 00:24:28.126
Can't you read the room?

00:24:34.438 --> 00:24:36.093
[Oh Bitna]

00:24:37.365 --> 00:24:38.695
Yeah, Bitna?

00:24:38.696 --> 00:24:40.978
Hao, look behind you.

00:24:47.313 --> 00:24:49.369
No, stay there. I'll go to you.

00:24:54.514 --> 00:24:56.046
What are you doing here all alone?

00:24:57.817 --> 00:24:59.938
- Did something happen?
- Huh?

00:25:01.566 --> 00:25:02.874
It's nothing.

00:25:03.539 --> 00:25:05.148
I don't think so...

00:25:05.706 --> 00:25:08.626
A woman's intuition never lies
and it's telling me something's up.

00:25:14.272 --> 00:25:15.732
Do you wanna go play basketball?

00:25:17.411 --> 00:25:19.585
I'm sure you'll have fun with me.

00:25:33.243 --> 00:25:34.422
Give it another try.

00:25:40.332 --> 00:25:41.959
You can't even make that?

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:43.991
What if I make it?

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.342
What do you want me to do for you?

00:25:46.217 --> 00:25:47.508
Grant me a wish.

00:25:48.083 --> 00:25:49.153
Sure.

00:25:57.022 --> 00:25:58.246
I made it!

00:25:58.247 --> 00:25:59.579
I made it, did you see that?

00:26:00.694 --> 00:26:02.337
How'd you make it all of a sudden?

00:26:05.637 --> 00:26:07.441
You had fun, right?

00:26:07.442 --> 00:26:09.588
Yeah, I laughed a lot thanks to you.

00:26:09.589 --> 00:26:12.687
See? I told you you'd have fun with me.

00:26:12.688 --> 00:26:13.952
Yeah.

00:26:14.229 --> 00:26:16.382
Alright, so what's your wish?

00:26:18.856 --> 00:26:20.133
I'll tell you later.

00:26:21.204 --> 00:26:23.301
- Later?
- Yeah.

00:26:23.302 --> 00:26:25.341
But you have to listen to me, okay?

00:26:26.734 --> 00:26:28.059
Okay.

00:26:31.807 --> 00:26:34.568
- Can I go check that out?
- Sure.

00:26:37.659 --> 00:26:40.039
- Welcome, hello.
- Hello.

00:26:40.774 --> 00:26:42.301
This is pretty.

00:26:43.416 --> 00:26:45.017
This is pretty too.

00:26:52.551 --> 00:26:54.096
This looks good on you.

00:26:54.848 --> 00:26:55.968
It's pretty.

00:27:03.341 --> 00:27:05.744
Really? Does it look pretty?

00:27:07.525 --> 00:27:09.084
Here, we'll take this one.

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:13.292
You didn't have to...

00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:16.695
Thanks for today.

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:18.908
It's my gift.

00:27:20.572 --> 00:27:21.848
Thanks.

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:32.614
Hao bought me this. Isn't it pretty?

00:27:33.122 --> 00:27:35.964
Wow, you really
made history yesterday, didn't you?

00:27:36.118 --> 00:27:39.708
We even played basketball last night!

00:27:41.332 --> 00:27:43.242
That's insane!

Insane!

- I'm so happy.
- Let me see.

00:27:46.905 --> 00:27:49.512
- Isn't it pretty?
- Yeah, very pretty.

00:27:51.086 --> 00:27:52.544
What do you think? Is it pretty?

00:28:05.403 --> 00:28:07.603
Hao, let's go outside for a bit.

00:28:14.464 --> 00:28:16.160
I have a question.

00:28:16.796 --> 00:28:17.845
Yeah?

00:28:18.385 --> 00:28:21.243
Why'd you ask me to take care of Hyun-gyu
for the Human Carrot thing?

[Human Carrot To-Do List]

00:28:23.452 --> 00:28:25.062
What are you doing, Hao?

00:28:26.329 --> 00:28:28.024
Let's go eat.

00:28:34.757 --> 00:28:36.908
If you don't wanna say, you don't have to.

00:28:39.062 --> 00:28:42.446
I think Hyun-gyu likes Bitna, though.

00:28:44.489 --> 00:28:45.727
What?

00:28:45.728 --> 00:28:47.106
I keep an eye out

00:28:47.367 --> 00:28:49.828
and every time you're with Bitna
he doesn't look too happy.

00:28:49.829 --> 00:28:51.607
Maybe that's why he was mean to you?

00:29:01.403 --> 00:29:04.258

00:29:06.236 --> 00:29:07.550

aren't you basically dating

Right? But why isn't he confessing?

00:29:13.048 --> 00:29:15.115

00:29:48.553 --> 00:29:49.929
The one Hao got you?

00:29:50.152 --> 00:29:52.456
Yeah, what do I do?

00:30:03.472 --> 00:30:06.398
It's probably in the garden outside.
Let's go look for it later.

00:30:06.834 --> 00:30:08.377
What if someone takes it?

00:30:08.824 --> 00:30:10.520
I'll just go check right now.

00:30:11.826 --> 00:30:13.242
Teacher's coming!

00:30:16.764 --> 00:30:18.524
Hey, guys!

00:30:18.525 --> 00:30:20.393
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:30:23.897 --> 00:30:25.541
You can go sit over there.

00:31:07.565 --> 00:31:09.659
[Azaleas] [Kim Sowol]
I'll let you go without a word.

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:11.278
Love that.

00:31:14.236 --> 00:31:15.720
I'm sorry.

00:31:15.721 --> 00:31:17.455
Don't be late, okay?

00:31:19.401 --> 00:31:20.544
By the way

00:31:20.545 --> 00:31:23.493
do you even understand the assignment
your student teacher gave you?

00:31:23.494 --> 00:31:25.622
- No.
- No, we don't.

00:31:29.332 --> 00:31:30.514
Love.

00:31:33.178 --> 00:31:37.179
She's asking you
to rethink the value of love.

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:39.410
Do you know what love is?

00:31:39.411 --> 00:31:40.955
For me, love is...

00:31:41.833 --> 00:31:44.833
It's about valuing love

00:31:44.834 --> 00:31:47.758
when it unexpectedly
shows up at your door.

00:31:47.759 --> 00:31:49.719
Love.

00:31:51.004 --> 00:31:52.502
Okay, guys?

00:31:55.715 --> 00:31:56.966
Right?

00:31:56.967 --> 00:31:59.030
Yes, you're exactly right.

00:32:04.739 --> 00:32:07.099
[Thanks]

00:32:17.594 --> 00:32:18.795
Is that your little brother?

00:32:21.767 --> 00:32:24.925
You look exactly alike!
You could pass as twins.

00:32:25.188 --> 00:32:26.556
He's cute.

00:32:42.099 --> 00:32:44.203
Hao, can we talk?

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:46.830
Right now?

00:32:56.231 --> 00:32:57.573
What's happening?

00:32:58.519 --> 00:32:59.654
What's going on?

00:33:02.846 --> 00:33:05.078
- I think he's really gonna confess.
- I know, right?

00:33:08.473 --> 00:33:11.108
Is he confessing? Really?

00:33:13.492 --> 00:33:15.030
You're not very aware, are you?

00:33:15.975 --> 00:33:17.172
Huh?

00:33:18.472 --> 00:33:20.661
I'm giving you the signal

00:33:21.035 --> 00:33:22.949
to confess to me.

00:33:28.875 --> 00:33:30.446
Well, I guess

00:33:30.447 --> 00:33:32.664
there's no rule
saying the guy has to confess, right?

00:33:32.665 --> 00:33:34.725
- Bitna.
- Yeah?

00:33:36.911 --> 00:33:38.066
I'm sorry.

00:33:40.237 --> 00:33:41.420
For what?

00:33:42.701 --> 00:33:44.977
Why are you sorry?

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:48.644
So...

00:33:49.841 --> 00:33:52.730
I've never thought of you
as more than a friend.

00:33:54.981 --> 00:33:56.359
Liar.

00:33:58.095 --> 00:33:59.255
Sorry.

00:34:01.451 --> 00:34:06.113
Then why were you nice to me?

00:34:06.129 --> 00:34:09.205
Why did you laugh?
Why did you get me a hairpin?

00:34:09.969 --> 00:34:11.971
I was nice to you

00:34:12.964 --> 00:34:14.966
because I was your Secret Santa.

00:34:16.516 --> 00:34:17.599
What?

00:34:23.538 --> 00:34:24.773
Jerk.

00:34:52.631 --> 00:34:54.624
- Why is she here?
- So...

00:34:54.625 --> 00:34:56.284
Hao totally rejected her.

00:34:56.285 --> 00:34:57.483
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

00:34:57.821 --> 00:35:00.324
Be quiet
it's nothing to get excited over.

00:35:00.325 --> 00:35:02.275
What do you mean?
The whole school knows already.

00:35:02.276 --> 00:35:03.806
So many people saw it happen.

00:35:03.807 --> 00:35:05.602
I said be quiet.

00:35:14.805 --> 00:35:16.284
You're so annoying.

00:35:30.152 --> 00:35:31.771
Hold it in, Nam Hyun-gyu.

00:35:33.582 --> 00:35:34.882
Hold it in.

00:35:39.103 --> 00:35:40.396
Erase it.

00:35:41.222 --> 00:35:42.393
What?

00:35:43.186 --> 00:35:44.391
Is that your little brother?

00:35:48.636 --> 00:35:50.982
Are you not getting it?

00:35:51.361 --> 00:35:53.208
Take the picture down, you jerk!

00:35:55.335 --> 00:35:56.842
You need to calm down.

00:35:57.713 --> 00:35:59.006
We're at school.

00:35:59.007 --> 00:36:00.872
- Do you wanna die?
- What are you doing?

00:36:05.034 --> 00:36:07.308
Please, please...

What did I ever do to you?

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:20.949
Do you think
I wanted to be born like this?

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:22.588
It's not even my fault!

00:36:23.364 --> 00:36:24.986
What are you saying?

00:36:29.353 --> 00:36:30.513
Hey, stop!

Stop it, stop!

What do you guys think you're doing?

00:36:36.631 --> 00:36:38.443
You want me to transfer?

00:36:38.934 --> 00:36:40.464
I'll go, then.

00:36:45.652 --> 00:36:47.856
Are you not going to
tell me what happened?

00:37:05.156 --> 00:37:08.515
With the way you look
you'll need at least two weeks to recover.

00:37:10.143 --> 00:37:11.562
Is this going to the school board?

00:37:12.351 --> 00:37:13.639
No.

00:37:14.831 --> 00:37:16.182
These two

00:37:17.383 --> 00:37:18.724
are brothers.

00:37:19.785 --> 00:37:20.860
Whoa!

00:37:23.577 --> 00:37:25.052
They were brothers?

00:37:25.984 --> 00:37:27.395
I can't believe it.

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:32.214
Holy shit, this is huge!

00:37:34.094 --> 00:37:35.534
How does that work?

00:37:36.012 --> 00:37:37.922
One is from China...

00:37:38.264 --> 00:37:39.746
So, they're half-brothers?

00:37:41.014 --> 00:37:42.757
- This is big news.
- Dude.

00:37:42.758 --> 00:37:44.538

Man, this is next-level crazy.

Dude, watch what you say.

00:37:51.427 --> 00:37:53.901
Right, I went too far.

00:37:56.073 --> 00:38:00.035
But, everyone has a reason for rebelling.

00:38:06.226 --> 00:38:09.624
It's true Hao's the bad guy
but he can't help being handsome.

I feel so bad for Hyun-gyu.

What's going on?

00:38:12.636 --> 00:38:15.517
Hyun-gyu and Hao fought
and they're brothers.

00:38:15.518 --> 00:38:17.930
Half-brothers at that.

00:38:19.341 --> 00:38:20.385
Whoa!

not to say anything!

Dang! I should've
gotten him something for Secret Santa!

Aren't you gonna give up?

00:38:38.857 --> 00:38:41.401
No, why would I give up?
I trust my instincts.

00:38:42.406 --> 00:38:46.436
I'm sure Hao turned me down
because he had a reason.

00:38:48.278 --> 00:38:49.412
Wow.

I need to help them make up.

You're the one who told me
to understand how the kids feel.

Are you worried about Hao right now?

Why do you think Hyun-gyu is acting out?

00:39:48.416 --> 00:39:50.107
It's all because of Hao!

00:45:31.643 --> 00:45:33.487
That's what I wanted to say.

00:45:34.225 --> 00:45:35.937
But I'm gonna get over you now

00:45:36.391 --> 00:45:38.488
although it might take a while.

00:45:49.083 --> 00:45:50.677
Hey! Hyun-gyu!

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:52.689
You were damn awesome today!

00:45:53.752 --> 00:45:56.779
Can't you talk without saying "damn"?

00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:57.985
Geez...

00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:01.035
Hey, just let me be.

00:46:13.158 --> 00:46:15.748
Sorry for being so difficult.

00:46:17.354 --> 00:46:18.582
Don't worry about it.

00:46:22.098 --> 00:46:23.442
Oh, and...

00:46:23.784 --> 00:46:26.036
I'm telling you because
you seem to have caught on

00:46:26.566 --> 00:46:29.364
but I'm over Bitna.

00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:34.988
Just letting you know.

00:46:43.076 --> 00:46:44.608
They really are brothers.

00:47:09.356 --> 00:47:11.428
Damn, it's so hot.

00:47:24.022 --> 00:47:25.313
Are you drunk?

00:47:26.528 --> 00:47:28.905
- What?
- Nah, it's just

00:47:29.584 --> 00:47:31.210
you look drunk on victory.

00:47:31.868 --> 00:47:33.634
Oh, that's what you meant...

00:47:34.165 --> 00:47:39.124
Anyway, you and Hao have great teamwork.

00:47:40.084 --> 00:47:41.753
Is it because you're half-brothers?

00:47:47.359 --> 00:47:48.679
What? You gonna hit me?

00:47:52.367 --> 00:47:53.595
Just stop.

00:47:56.874 --> 00:47:59.419
But your dad must have some crazy skills.

00:48:00.703 --> 00:48:04.546
China, Korea.
He went international, huh?

00:48:06.043 --> 00:48:07.809
Do you wanna die?

00:48:09.518 --> 00:48:10.909
This jerk...

00:48:13.684 --> 00:48:16.090
Guys! Nam Hyun-gyu
and Lee Jinho are fighting!

00:48:16.091 --> 00:48:17.344
Hurry up!

00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:18.658
Hurry!

00:48:19.726 --> 00:48:21.072
Wait for me!

00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:09.913
Hey!

00:49:37.648 --> 00:49:38.856
Are you okay?

00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:07.787
- Hey!
- Stop!

00:50:28.171 --> 00:50:29.468
He's so cool.

00:50:29.883 --> 00:50:31.282
No joke.

00:50:35.234 --> 00:50:38.035
What's happening?
Didn't they fight?

00:50:38.408 --> 00:50:40.668
- When'd they get so close?
- I don't know.

00:50:44.608 --> 00:50:48.330
It's normal for brothers to fight.

00:50:48.733 --> 00:50:49.893
Hao!

00:50:51.412 --> 00:50:53.260
- What did he say?
- I don't know.

00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:56.976
It's normal for brothers to fight.

00:51:00.598 --> 00:51:02.160
That's super cool.

00:51:02.785 --> 00:51:03.854
So cool.

00:51:24.947 --> 00:51:26.333
Is this your little spot?

00:51:27.124 --> 00:51:28.189
Yeah.

00:51:28.446 --> 00:51:29.576
It's nice.

00:51:34.403 --> 00:51:37.640
I saw a few videos of DJ Zedd yesterday
and he was awesome.

00:51:38.804 --> 00:51:39.940
Why?

00:51:40.294 --> 00:51:42.055
I studied up for you, man.

00:51:42.544 --> 00:51:43.882
I also saw

00:51:44.831 --> 00:51:45.939
Skrill...

00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:48.044
- Skrillex.
- Yeah, he was good.

00:51:48.596 --> 00:51:50.786
It'd be nice if we could
go to a concert sometime.

00:51:55.742 --> 00:51:57.067
How do you do this?

00:51:57.449 --> 00:51:59.943
- Dude, be careful.
- Sorry.

00:52:06.117 --> 00:52:07.596
Oh, and...

00:52:09.134 --> 00:52:12.213
Don't transfer schools, big bro.

00:52:23.714 --> 00:52:26.275
[Oh Bitna]

00:52:28.114 --> 00:52:29.809
Answer, I'm okay.

00:52:31.086 --> 00:52:32.711
You guys look good together.

00:52:34.084 --> 00:52:36.277
What are you talking about?
I'm not interested.

00:52:36.278 --> 00:52:38.002
You can stop, I already know.

00:52:47.611 --> 00:52:48.826
You ready?

00:52:52.898 --> 00:52:56.633
And just like that, my first love ended
before I could even confess how I felt.

00:52:57.605 --> 00:53:01.008
Some might call it a loser's first love

00:53:01.009 --> 00:53:03.590
but I realized something.

00:53:04.973 --> 00:53:06.822
I realized that the person I like

00:53:06.823 --> 00:53:09.395
can fall for someone other than me.

00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:13.817
And the moment I came to terms with it
I felt like I'd grown up a little.

00:53:14.218 --> 00:53:16.082
So now, I can say it.

00:53:16.083 --> 00:53:19.139
I call touché on my first love.

00:53:42.034 --> 00:53:44.629
[First Love]

00:53:45.421 --> 00:53:46.689
What are you looking at?

00:53:47.965 --> 00:53:50.534
- What? Got a picture of Woong?
- No!

00:53:50.535 --> 00:53:52.124
What is this? Does Woong know?

00:53:52.125 --> 00:53:53.579
That you secretly
carry around a photo of him?

00:53:54.764 --> 00:53:56.568
Ow! My head!

00:53:56.569 --> 00:53:57.890
Are you two dating?

00:53:57.891 --> 00:53:59.423
I'm done holding back.

00:53:59.593 --> 00:54:01.818
I stayed up watching Euro 2024.

00:54:01.819 --> 00:54:03.516
You watch soccer?

00:54:03.517 --> 00:54:06.316
- I want to be with you forever.
- Forever?

00:54:06.317 --> 00:54:08.858
- You like Lee Ji-yoon?
- I'm thinking about asking her out.

00:54:08.859 --> 00:54:10.867
Even if you spend two million won
you'll never be a match for Woong.

00:54:10.868 --> 00:54:12.637
- Ha Sunwoo!
- What?

00:54:12.638 --> 00:54:14.029
If you like Ji-yoon, tell her.

00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:15.178
Do you mean that?

00:54:15.179 --> 00:54:17.718
- Four, three, two...
- One!

00:54:17.719 --> 00:54:18.787
Three!

00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:25.034
Wow, Ha Sunwoo
is there anything you won't do?

00:54:27.658 --> 00:54:29.919
I told you to just be honest
and admit you're bad!

00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:31.511
Isn't she Ha Sunwoo's girlfriend?

00:54:31.512 --> 00:54:32.876
She keeps looking this way.
