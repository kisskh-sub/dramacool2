[The Journey of Legend]

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.850
[Episode 21]

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.190
Shao Liulei, how dare you!

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.710
I will kill you!

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.350
Mr. Shao, why did you do this?

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.400
Boy.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.350
If Crazy Yan really sent you to find me,

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.960
he'd surely be protecting you in secret.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.280
But when this girl
tried to steal the pill,

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.610
he still didn't show up.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.210
This proves you're lying.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.430
The moment

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.500
you claimed
that Crazy Yan felt guilty toward me,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.829
you gave yourself away.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.630
He abducted me for 10 years,

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.630
using every cruel method imaginable on me.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.510
How could he possibly feel guilty?

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.450
So Shao Liulei was testing me
from the very beginning.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.910
Never thought
he'd been scheming all along.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.050
What's even more ridiculous is

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.500
that you want to take this Infinite Pill.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.190
Since you know

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.630
he forced me to take
half of the Yang pill,

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.710
in no case would he
leave the Yin pill behind.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.630
This last pill is the half Yang pill.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.360
Once you take it,

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.750
you'll end up with the same fate as me,

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.079
being tortured by the primal Yang energy.

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:52.360
That's worse than death.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.160
You're not his younger brother.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.079
You lied to me!

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.610
I hate being deceived more than anything.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.790
You all say I betrayed them
to help Crazy Yan.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.230
But it was actually Zhu the Great King

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.630
using me as a shield
against his fatal move.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.590
He deceived me, too.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.150
He lied to me

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.710
that the Long River's waterways
would see me as a hero.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.480
But after suffering for so many years,

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.840
I escaped only to hear

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.010
that you all consider me a traitor.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:35.640
Why did I escape?

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.280
Was it really to offer this elixir

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.480
to Zhu the Great King?

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.560
I want him to swallow it.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.150
I want him to suffer

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.090
from the primal Yang energy every day
just like me.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.290
I'll make all of you who once deceived me

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.310
taste every bit

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.910
of the suffering I've endured!

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.120
You attacked me from behind when I was
suffering from the primal Yang energy.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.390
Guess what I most want to do now.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.800
What do you want to do?

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.750
My body is about to burst
due to the primal Yang energy.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.890
I need to balance Yin and Yang, of course.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.950
They told me that in Yunxia Mountain,

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.140
there are spiritual insects
used to make Yin pills.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.510
Taking them would relieve my suffering.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.010
But I've searched for so long
and found nothing.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.630
All liars!

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.830
Now I'll use you to relieve my pain.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.850
Do you know who I am?

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.760
I know.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:51.690
A beautiful woman.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.990
I work for Mr. Liu, Liu Suifeng.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.909
If you dare lay a finger on me,

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.610
my master will make you suffer
a hundred times more than you do now.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.190
Even if what you say is true,

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.450
do you think I'd care about it?

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.950
You look so beautiful when you're angry.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.320
Don't you dare!

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.490
Shao Liulei,

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.310
you'll regret this.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:58.720
Boy,

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:00.530
you're way too nice.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:02.630
Mr. Shao,

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.800
what makes us human

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.560
is that we must have some dignity.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.870
Dignity?

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.400
Who are you to talk to me about dignity?

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.240
Do you know what I've been through
these past ten years?

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.500
I've lived like neither human nor ghost,

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.320
worse off than a rat!

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.190
Have you ever suffered like I have?

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.180
Not having experienced my pain,

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.010
how dare you talk to me about dignity?

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.390
Since you're so righteous,

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.640
swallow this Yang pill.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.770
Then you'll end up just like me.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.020
I have Crazy Yan's vital energy
to keep me alive.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.070
But you don't.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.550
You'll be tortured to death
within two hours.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.350
But you can learn from me.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:02.480
Use this girl

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.560
to ease your pain for a few days.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.510
Then let me see

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.310
what you'll choose between your life

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.200
and your dignity.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:24.920
Boy,

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.360
if death comes after the sexual pleasure,

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.760
I'd call it a good ending.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.800
I've sealed this girl's pressure points

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:32.680
and yours, too.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.000
I'll throw both of you
to the bottom of the valley.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.800
By then,

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.240
an antidote at your disposal

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.040
will be lying right beside you.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.530
You...

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.760
What will you choose?

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:47.800
To live

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:49.950
or to die?

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:52.000
To live

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:53.870
or to die?

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:55.750
To live

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.920
or to die?

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.000
Zhu the Great King,

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.410
I haven't gotten even with you yet.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:23.400
The Yang pill is gone,
and I'll get you another poisonous pill.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.670
I must have my revenge.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.000
You took that pill.

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:52.720
A-Are you alright?

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.480
Song Mingzhu,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.900
I'll never forgive you
for massacring my family.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.300
If you want to live,
get the hell out of here.

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.190
Unlock my pressure points.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:02.500
I can help you heal.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.190
Shut up!

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.040
Xiao Qiushui.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.440
Now you can kill me if you want.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.040
I have no strength to resist.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:16.380
Even if you saved me,

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.150
next time,

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.320
I'd still fight you with all my might

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.080
for my master

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.840
and show no mercy.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.810
I can't unlock your pressure points.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.080
I can't stop the pill
from taking effect on me.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:29.750
Once the time's up,

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.470
your pressure points will be unlocked.

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:32.240
Listen,

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.640
get the hell
as far away from me as possible!

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:34.690
My body is about to burst
due to the primal Yang energy.

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:36.940
I need to balance Yin and Yang, of course.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:39.000
They told me that in Yunxia Mountain,

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.070
there are spiritual insects
used to make Yin pills.

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:43.500
Taking them would relieve my suffering.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:50.900
Snake venom.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:54.030
Could it be that the white snake's venom

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.160
is the ingredient
for the Yin pill of the Infinite Pill?

Xiao Qiushui,

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:28.260
you're really different from others.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.140
If it were me,

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.320
as long as I could survive
a few more days,

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:34.780
I wouldn't care about anyone else's life.

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:37.900
Thanks.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:42.120
Stop there.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.270
You people from the Power Gang

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:48.210
truly have no conscience.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:52.300
Song Mingzhu, answer me.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:55.680
Where are my parents' bodies?

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.690
You saved my life today.

00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.610
So I'll tell you honestly.

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:01.330
Your parents' bodies

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:02.930
were taken away by my master.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.280
But I really don't know

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.540
where he sent them.

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:07.390
As someone so close to him,

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:08.570
how could you not know?

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:10.650
My master only mentioned
he had leads to follow.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:12.180
How could I dare to ask more?

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:22.900
You'd better not be lying.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
I should've killed you with one blow

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:29.770
and sent your bodies

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:32.180
one by one to the Sword Manor

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:35.790
to avenge
those of the Xiao family who died in vain.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.510
Go tell Liu Suifeng

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:40.650
and that Li Chenzhou.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.220
For the blood debts your Power Gang owes,

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:46.190
I will settle them one by one.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:00.250
Xiao Qiushui has actually absorbed
the Infinite Pill.

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:02.990
Isn't Master in danger then?

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:05.870
Have all the Power Gang members left?

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:07.780
Is this place safe now?

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.830
Roushui and the others are
dealing with the Power Gang.

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:12.690
Go ahead with what you want to say.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:17.710
I risked my life

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.670
to seize this Infinite Pill

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:22.730
just to present it to the King.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:34.270
You've done well.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.450
I will tell the Heavenly King
about your dedication.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.640
Long time no see, Kang Chuyu.

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.090
Xiao Qiushui?

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.590
What are you doing here,
you good-for-nothing?

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:06.370
Take a guess.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.720
I have serious matters to attend to.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.920
If you wish to die,
I'll come kill you later.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.050
I'm afraid you won't be leaving today.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.480
You're asking for death.

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:36.650
Didn't expect this man
to have such powerful internal energy.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:47.850
Kang Chuyu.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.210
You betrayed your friends,
against all loyalty.

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:56.340
You slaughtered the innocent,
against all morality.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.600
You deserve to die the most tragic death!

00:16:59.050 --> 00:16:59.730
Today,

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:02.400
I will make you pay for the deaths

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.400
of over 100 people in my Xiao family!

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.200
Tang Rou,

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.120
did you see that?

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:33.670
I finally made Kang Chuyu pay
for your death.

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:35.620
Father,

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:37.640
Mother,

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.540
for the blood debts of our family,

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.500
I will settle them one by one.

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:27.330
Now that Zhu the Great King knows

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:29.760
that we're enemies
of the Shaolin and Wudang Sects,

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.040
you're still causing trouble everywhere
during this time,

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.170
hampering our gang's every move.

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:37.610
How dare you show your face here?

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.720
I know my sins are unforgivable.

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:43.010
But I submit myself
to the Chief's judgment.

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:45.140
I only want the Chief to give me a chance

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:46.420
to atone for my sins.

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:48.880
The Chief already gave you a chance before

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:49.880
and let you leave.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.910
But you chose to stay.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.530
Since you want this opportunity,

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:55.360
the Chief said

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.620
you must seek it yourself.

00:18:58.290 --> 00:18:59.890
Is this what the Chief means?

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:04.410
I understand.

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:09.550
I'll set out for Wudang Sect now
to beg for forgiveness.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:24.170
I never thought you'd be the one
to see me off in the end.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.450
Liu Suifeng,

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:28.680
are you still suspecting

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:32.650
that I sent someone
to impersonate the Chief to frame you?

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:35.700
No way it was you.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.650
You don't have the audacity

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:43.490
to have someone impersonate the Chief.

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.020
Put these on yourself.

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:10.450
Liu Suifeng,

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:11.770
wake up!

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.490
Don't you dare die on the way.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.650
It'd mess up my mission.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.400
The Chief wants me
to reach the Wudang Sect alive.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.000
And I certainly will make it.

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.840
Greetings from the Wudang Sect.

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:30.720
Our sect leader sent us here
to receive you.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.780
Please hand this criminal over to us.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:33.960
Greetings, sirs.

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:36.010
When was this arrangement made?

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:37.270
I've never heard of it.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:41.180
This is a letter from our sect leader.

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.810
[To the Power Gang]

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:46.090
He was concerned
about your fatigue from the long journey.

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:47.750
Since there's still some distance
to the Wudang Sect,

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:49.410
he ordered us to come meet you.

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:51.090
This is true.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:52.330
Judging by the handwriting,

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:55.400
this is indeed
the Wudang Sect's official correspondence.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.010
You two must be tired
from your journey north.

00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:58.330
You could rest nearby.

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:00.740
We'll take the criminal from here.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:13.960
Wait.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:18.010
We only briefly informed the Wudang Sect

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:19.880
that we'd be escorting Liu Suifeng
to face punishment.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.320
How did you know
we were traveling north?

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.520
Just a slip of the tongue.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.530
Blade King, please don't overthink it.

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:28.290
We've been traveling discreetly.

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:29.820
We should have headed east.

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:31.790
But to avoid attention,

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:33.680
we deliberately detoured
to the southern stronghold

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.680
and then headed north to the Wudang Sect.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.490
How could you possibly know about it?

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:38.590
Could it be that someone

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:40.790
leaked our itinerary to you in advance?

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:47.810
Tell me

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:49.920
who sent you here.

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:02.010
You must have

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:04.620
stolen our correspondence

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.660
and rushed to forge this letter, right?

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:07.200
Move!

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:03.530
Chieftess?

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:06.880
Chieftess.

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:12.090
We fell into their trap.

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.300
Thankfully, you came to help.

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:16.360
Thank you for your help, Chieftess.

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.160
These people have finally shown

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:19.530
their sly true colors.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.280
Take them back for interrogation.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:22.800
Yes.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.440
Leave Liu Suifeng to me.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.260
Even though you did something wrong,

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:47.350
he still can't bear to let you die.

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:50.500
[15 years ago]

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:51.170
Stop there!

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:52.650
You brat! Stop there!

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:53.420
Stop!

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:55.010
Stop running!

00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:58.760
I'll kill you!

00:24:59.030 --> 00:24:59.470
Hey..

00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:01.180
How dare you flee?

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:02.270
You won't get away!

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.010
I'll

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:04.700
beat you to death!

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:34.270
Why did you save me?

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:36.910
Why did I save you?

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.400
Let me think about it.

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:40.940
You saved my life.

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:43.960
In return, I'll help you kill a person.

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.040
That doesn't sound

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:51.250
very appealing.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.800
Then I'll give my life to you.

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.160
Give your life to me?
That's not necessary.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.570
I like the coldness in your eyes.

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:08.330
It would be a waste for you to die here.

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:14.970
Take this.

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:41.640
You've been following me all the way.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.680
What's wrong?

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:44.130
My life is yours now.

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.890
Where else could I go
if I'm not following you?

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:50.790
But you've been tortured
to a terrible state.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.490
What's the point of keeping you around us?

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:55.970
If I recover,
I can kill and plunder for you.

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:58.300
If not, I can chop wood and lead horses.

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.200
I can be useful either way.

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.410
Things have come to this point,

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:13.650
yet the Chief still hasn't abandoned me.

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:15.180
I felt something on the way.

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:18.080
I just didn't know
the Chief's detailed plan.

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:19.730
So I could only play along.

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:22.800
So you had noticed that it was

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.530
Chenzhou's plan
to lure the snake out of its hole.

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.870
If the Chief wants me to sacrifice myself

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:37.820
to appease the wrath
of the Shaolin and Wudang Sects,

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:40.910
I would do so without complaint.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.010
Suifeng,

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:46.530
both Chenzhou and I
have long placed our trust in you.

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:49.390
We know that even if everyone
in our gang betrays us,

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:50.460
you never would.

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:53.720
Our gang has made many enemies
over the years.

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.780
Our previous plans were all exposed.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:56.920
Chenzhou thought

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.290
that there must be
spies and moles planted within our gang.

00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:01.750
If we don't get rid of them,

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.260
there will never be peace in our gang.

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:06.640
So we utilized the case

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.680
of you killing Tianzheng and Taichan

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.280
to make a fuss and set up a trap

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:11.680
to root out these spies.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.920
The Chief is truly far-sighted.

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:17.640
I owe my life

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.810
to you and the Chief.

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:24.110
If there ever comes a day
when you truly lose trust in me,

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.440
I'll literally end up
like a walking corpse.

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.370
I'd rather die than live like that.

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.040
You should rest here.

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.850
I'll go back
to interrogate those traitors.

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:36.050
If there are any updates,
I'll send someone to inform you.

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:04.490
Master.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.250
It's getting cold at night.

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:11.360
Please take care and rest well, Master.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.050
I'm fine.

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.520
I heard you got into trouble,

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:16.960
and I was so worried.

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:18.890
My issue's been settled.

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.720
The Chief's no longer blaming me.

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.720
Master, if you leave the Power Gang,

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.400
I, the Red Phoenix,

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.240
will have no attachment to it either.

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.170
While I was away,

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:30.730
how were things going
with the Xiao family?

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.160
Don't worry, Master.

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.920
Xiao Yiren's been sending
recruitment invitations all over Jindu,

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.920
trying to rebuild the Huanhua Sect,

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:40.440
but no one's interested.
They're getting nowhere.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.090
Those small sects
that used to follow the Xiao family

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:43.400
have turned against them, too.

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.960
Xiao Yiren is headstrong and arrogant,

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.170
obsessed with being a hero.

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:51.710
But he only cares about maintaining
a hollow reputation.

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:53.670
He can't cause us any trouble.

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.570
But that Xiao Qiushui...

00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.170
Someone like him

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.810
is lucky just to survive
in the martial world.

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:03.400
He doesn't deserve your attention, Master.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.200
Do you genuinely think
he's not worth mentioning,

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.050
or are you trying to protect him?

00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:12.300
Please speak plainly, Master.

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:15.130
I can tolerate occasional failures,

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.530
but you should know well

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:19.710
about the consequences of betrayal.

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.400
I dare not do that.

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:25.290
I will never betray you
in my life, Master.

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:26.720
If you suspect me,

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:30.010
you can kill me right now.

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.970
I suppose you wouldn't dare betray me.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.000
You didn't mention a word
about the Infinite Pill.

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:41.050
Did something go wrong?

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:44.340
Where is it?

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:47.870
One was swallowed by Shao Liulei.

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.010
And the other one

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.690
was grabbed by the Flame Lord, Cai Qishen.

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.800
Shao Liulei's martial arts are
stronger than mine.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.060
I went through great trouble

00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:58.590
just to escape and survive.

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.180
If this happens again,

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:04.820
don't bother coming back.

00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:07.850
You may leave now.

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:09.060
Yes, Master.

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:33.750
Even if I'm willing to die for my master,

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:36.830
it didn't move him at all.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:41.580
Song Mingzhu,

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:44.440
what are you still fantasizing about?

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:49.410
I'm satisfied with just staying

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:51.290
by Master's side.

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:05.960
These days, the Chieftess and I

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:08.950
have been secretly investigating clues
about this falconry whistle.

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:11.610
We only know it's a mysterious group
backed up by the Northern Wasteland,

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:15.920
deliberately planted in the martial world
to work for the Northern Wasteland.

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.770
I always use one blade for one kill.

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:19.010
These are for you.

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:21.880
Confess or choose a blade.

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:22.840
It's up to you.

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:38.880
The Misery Pill from the Death Beetle is
incredibly powerful.

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:41.150
If you don't reveal
who's behind this falconry whistle now,

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:43.010
I'll let it roam inside your body.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.530
By day, you'll suffer unbearable itching,
like being tortured by numerous ants.

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:47.880
At night, you'll endure excruciating pain,
like being skinned alive.

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.010
You'll keep begging

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:49.880
for relief.

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:53.010
I only know the leaders met
at Qingfeng Mansion.

00:32:55.050 --> 00:33:00.010
[Qingfeng Mansion]

00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:29.850
Fire King, you made one wrong move,

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:31.160
then everything went wrong.

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.400
So you ended up here.

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:39.900
You and I are old acquaintances.

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:42.970
We've always been on good terms
in the gang and never fought before.

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:43.810
I've prepared a blade

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:45.340
for each of you Seven Kings.

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:47.490
Take your pick.

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:58.130
Li Chenzhou must be out of his mind,

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:01.200
sending you over to kill me.

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:02.460
That's not true.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.360
I just want you to tell me

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:06.050
who's behind this falconry whistle.

00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:07.970
As for whether we should
kill you, Fire King,

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:08.900
it's not up to me.

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:17.790
You traitor to the gang,

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:19.440
you have nowhere to escape.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.639
This is the Marching Pill formula

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:37.239
found in your mansion.

00:34:39.699 --> 00:34:41.230
And that falconry whistle.

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:45.830
They're enough to prove you betrayed us
and colluded with the Northern Wasteland.

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:47.360
What else do you have to say?

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.170
Since you have figured it out,

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:53.010
I need to say no more.

00:34:53.679 --> 00:34:54.480
That's right.

00:34:54.969 --> 00:34:57.490
We've long been Falconry Whistle members.

00:34:59.160 --> 00:34:59.840
Fire King,

00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:01.860
you're an elder of our gang.

00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:04.110
I'll give you a chance to make amends.

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:06.220
Tell us honestly who your superior is

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:10.660
and if there are others in the gang
working for the Falconry Whistle.

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:17.270
The Falconry Whistle's rise is
unstoppable.

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:21.490
It's too late for you to do anything!

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:22.160
Fine.

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:23.790
Then let me ask you.

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.370
Were you involved in the massacre

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:29.800
of the Baicao Valley back then?

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.680
I've been living
as quite a figure for all my life.

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.640
If I did it, I would never deny it.

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:38.090
If I didn't do it,
in no case would I admit it.

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:43.840
I stole that formula
from the Diancang Sect.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.090
As for this Baicao Valley,

00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:49.490
I know nothing about it.

00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:53.970
You, Liu Suifeng,
just killed Tianzheng and Taichan,

00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:56.570
causing outrage
throughout the martial world.

00:35:56.570 --> 00:35:59.200
How dare you still keep him by your side?

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:05.610
The Power Gang's days are numbered,
I guess.

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:07.800
As for everything I've done,

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.050
it was all for long-term planning.

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:13.570
You're thinking too highly of yourselves.

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:16.020
You think you're the only ones who know

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:20.240
what's inside that Hero Command Token?

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:23.090
Still showing no remorse, you'll be

00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:25.020
dealt with under the gang's rules!

00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:29.010
I've long anticipated this day.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:30.970
Back then,

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:34.320
to prevent wars
among the Eight Kings, Li Chenzhou

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:35.410
made us take

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:38.160
the Misery Pills made from our own blood.

00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:43.800
Now I've mastered
the foreign Vein Melting Technique

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:47.380
and have already
purged the poison from my veins.

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:52.200
If they kill me, the poison will act up,

00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:55.010
and they can only see themselves die.

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:58.570
But I can kill them!

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:30.260
The Death Beetle has
come out of his body.

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.800
The restriction effect of the Misery Pill
in the Fire King's body is removed.

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:34.800
He is no longer one of the Eight Kings.

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.000
We can attack him now.

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:42.290
I'll take you to hell with me!

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:45.580
I'll use this Flame Palm
I've hidden for a decade

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:48.160
to burn you all to ashes!

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.980
This blade is called Piercer.

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:57.980
Your death honors its name.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.460
I feel sorry for you, Suifeng.

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.500
He's not the foe you're after.

00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:23.770
You will have to wait again
to get your revenge.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:31.160
At least we retrieved the formula
before it fell into the wrong hands.

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:34.420
This should bring some peace
to the souls of Baicao Valley.

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:39.200
But the Fire King was determined to die.

00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:42.460
The Falconry Whistle's spies
and their plans

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.250
will need further investigation.

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:49.200
The Fire King refused to confess
till his death.

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.640
It shows how far-reaching
the Falconry Whistle's schemes are.

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.280
They tricked Suifeng into killing
Tianzheng and Taichan,

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.490
creating conflicts between us
and the Shaolin and Wudang Sects

00:38:56.490 --> 00:38:59.220
as well as internal strife
within the Power Gang.

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:02.490
They're clearly no ordinary adversaries.

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:11.720
As flawless as the disguise technique was,

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:16.780
it could only be the Thousand-Faces Mask
of the Fei's three greatest artifacts.

00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:20.930
Back then, Mr. Fei claimed

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:24.060
that the Thousand-Faces Mask was
burned and destroyed.

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:27.370
But I've always had my doubts about that.

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:29.970
I have indeed heard
that this Thousand-Faces Mask

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:32.430
has the miraculous power
to deceive anyone.

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:34.770
If our enemies truly possess it,

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:37.500
it'll be even more difficult
to deal with them.

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:40.680
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.370
We don't have much time left.

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:50.280
Suifeng.

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:52.720
Send someone to investigate

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:55.430
whether this matter is related
to the Fei family.

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.910
Yes.

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:57.320
Besides,

00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:59.430
tell the Ghost King to speed up

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:02.500
and produce more Death Beetles
as soon as possible.

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.180
The Ghost King reports

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.840
that over the past month,

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:07.880
the Insect King has lost its vitality

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:09.010
and is barely alive.

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:12.680
Only the Heaven-Earth Pool
behind the Insect Valley of the Tang Sect

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.010
can revitalize it.

00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:17.450
The Tang Sect never allows outsiders
into the Insect Valley.

00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:18.850
If we rush in recklessly,

00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:21.680
we might hurt the Insect King
and ruin everything.

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:22.970
On the Night of Yin-Hai,

00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:24.670
the Tang Sect
will compete for the position of Master,

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:27.400
which might cause them to open
the Insect Valley.

00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:29.050
When taking risky measures,

00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:31.570
you must be extremely cautious

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:34.420
and must not offend Old Madam Tang.

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:36.420
Understood.

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:38.660
I won't fail your trust, Chief.

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:45.960
Is there still something
you're worried about?

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:48.370
The Wudang Sect, the Shaolin Sect,

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:51.280
and other sects in the martial world are
seeking revenge against us.

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:54.200
Quite a few bases
of the Power Gang have been destroyed.

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.120
Now, Zhu the Great King
from the Long River waterways

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:57.720
has suddenly risen to power.

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:01.120
I feel something fishy about this.

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:04.530
The Falconry Whistle probably wants

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:07.730
far more than just to stir up trouble
in the martial world.

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:12.490
This mastermind
wants to challenge our Power Gang.

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:17.640
Then let's see what he's got.
