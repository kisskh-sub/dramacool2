=Episode 13=

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.519
So when that time comes,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.680
I'll vanish completely.

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:46.480
Right?

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.040
Is there any way

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.599
to eliminate the Night Deity within me?

00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:01.640
Only the Sword Master
with the Divine Sword

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.599
can oppose him.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.319
Are you saying

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:12.840
that if I lose control then,

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.120
you'll have to kill me personally?

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.280
I'll never let my life

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:28.879
lie in someone else's hand.

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:30.800
I refuse to believe

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.280
there's no other way

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.919
to suppress him
in the vast Three Realms.

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.159
Nor do I.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.080
We'll find a solution.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.560
Yes.

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.599
Right.

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.319
I heard

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.439
that descendants of Shennong
and those from Kunlun Ruins

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.000
possess many mystical arts.

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:53.599
Let's go look.

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.240
No need to rush.

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:59.000
Heal your injuries first.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.400
I won't travel with dead weight.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.599
Rest properly first.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.080
Our leader's not back.

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:27.159
Please stay here for two days.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.680
Once the leader returns,

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.919
I'll summon you both.

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.800
Thank you.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.960
Suit yourself.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.159
Let me do it.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.159
Legends say the Shennong Clan nurtures
a thousand-year-old Fireflow Fungus

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:54.599
that can suppress demonic energy.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.719
But its growth requirements
are extremely specific,

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.159
and there's been no trace of it
in recent years.

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:02.400
I'm afraid...

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:03.080
Afraid of what?

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.159
You claimed

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.719
you wouldn't let your life

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:07.840
lie in someone else's hand.

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.039
We haven't even met them yet,

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:12.199
but you're already doubting yourself.

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:13.840
I'm not.

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:19.379
Right.

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:21.379
On that street earlier,

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.060
I saw a pastry shop

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:25.300
with treats I've never tried.

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:28.100
Go buy some for me.

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:30.339
Let's go.

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:35.019
It's too far. I don't want to go.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.180
Fine. To thank you,

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.420
I'll cook tonight.

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:40.259
How's that?

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.500
I want fish.

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:44.620
Got it.

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:45.420
Just wait.

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:10.660
Back off!

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:13.860
Whatever you are,

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.180
I won't submit!

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:31.500
Chuli?

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:33.300
Chuli?

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.139
Chuli?

00:05:35.579 --> 00:05:36.139
Chuli?

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.180
Chuli?

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:38.420
What's wrong?

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.779
Chuli?

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:43.819
How was that?

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:46.420
Just kidding.

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:48.339
Scared you, didn't I?

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:50.740
My acting was convincing, right?

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:52.459
That was silly.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:53.899
What's silly about it?

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.899
I just wanted to see if you care.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.620
The more you care,

00:05:58.819 --> 00:05:59.819
the more you love me.

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:01.339
The more you love me,

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.300
the happier I am.

00:06:23.579 --> 00:06:24.220
Smile.

00:06:25.019 --> 00:06:26.100
Stop frowning all the time.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.740
Didn't you want my care?

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.259
That was before.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.459
Now I've changed my mind.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.459
I'm difficult to please.

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:39.379
So what?

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:40.819
Don't you like that?

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:42.939
I do.

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:45.660
I love every part of you.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.399
I'm already aware

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:07.920
of your purpose here.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.560
This young lady

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:12.879
has been invaded by demonic energy.

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:18.519
The Fireflow Fungus could suppress it,

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.920
but unfortunately

00:07:22.079 --> 00:07:24.600
it became extinct

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.399
eight centuries ago.

00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:32.220
However,

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:33.980
I heard

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.300
the Black River Grass
unique to Kunlun Mountain

00:07:37.819 --> 00:07:39.420
can suppress demonic energy.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.420
It might be worth trying.

00:08:00.459 --> 00:08:01.740
So bitter.

00:08:03.339 --> 00:08:04.939
Black River Grass is indeed bitter.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:10.819
Well?

00:08:14.939 --> 00:08:15.660
How do you feel?

00:08:17.779 --> 00:08:20.060
Some of the demonic energy
within me has been suppressed.

00:08:21.939 --> 00:08:23.139
This medicine works.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.540
(This medicine has minimal effect.)

00:08:27.259 --> 00:08:28.500
(It can't cure her at all.)

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:35.379
I must not have drunk enough yet.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.980
This medicine is unbearably bitter.

00:08:45.379 --> 00:08:46.019
Chen,

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:47.179
feed it to me.

00:09:07.659 --> 00:09:08.740
It's no longer bitter.

00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:10.419
I feel much better now.

00:09:15.539 --> 00:09:16.779

Why wait?

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.059
We should seize the moment

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:41.740
I'm not lying.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.019
Centuries ago, I told you I loved you.

00:12:49.259 --> 00:12:50.179
But you forgot.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:56.340
Alright.

00:12:59.019 --> 00:12:59.899
I believe you.

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:07.980
At least we didn't miss each other.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.980
Let's not miss each other ever again.

00:13:13.779 --> 00:13:14.580
We won't.

00:13:16.899 --> 00:13:17.899
Whether in the past,

00:13:18.899 --> 00:13:19.539
present,

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.019
or future,

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:25.980
I'll always find you

00:13:28.259 --> 00:13:29.259
and fall for you again.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:52.419
Young lady, care for a clay figurine?

00:13:55.139 --> 00:13:55.620
Sure.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:58.500
Sir,

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.220
make one in my likeness.

00:14:03.899 --> 00:14:04.379
Got it.

00:14:11.019 --> 00:14:11.700
So tiny.

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:18.220
It's done.

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:20.700
Careful.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:21.779
Thank you.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:23.419
Thank you.

00:14:23.779 --> 00:14:24.539
Thank you.

00:14:29.419 --> 00:14:30.299
Doesn't resemble you.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:32.500
What do you mean?

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.340
It's quite good.

00:14:43.259 --> 00:14:44.139
Take this figurine.

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:45.179
Keep it safe.

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:50.580
For me?

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:52.340
Yes.

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:57.779
I don't know

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.659
if my body will ever heal fully.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:04.100
Consider this a memento of me.

00:15:06.539 --> 00:15:07.419
If someday

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.919
I'm truly nearing my end,

00:15:14.259 --> 00:15:15.539
I'll allow you

00:15:16.059 --> 00:15:17.179
to love someone else later.

00:15:27.299 --> 00:15:28.100
However,

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:30.779
I have one condition.

00:15:33.179 --> 00:15:33.899
That is,

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:38.779
you must never forget me.

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:43.700
Normally,

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:45.740
you can keep it stored away.

00:15:47.419 --> 00:15:48.779
No need to display it publicly.

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.059
And no need to think of me daily.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:54.419
Just

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.539
when you occasionally see it,

00:16:04.899 --> 00:16:06.179
remember me then.

00:16:11.179 --> 00:16:11.700
How's that?

00:16:23.179 --> 00:16:23.899
I promise.

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:30.500
I won't forget

00:16:34.259 --> 00:16:35.820
anything that happened between us.

00:16:43.139 --> 00:16:44.100
But you...

00:16:45.419 --> 00:16:46.899
When we meet again,

00:16:48.379 --> 00:16:49.740
don't make me wait too long.

00:16:55.625 --> 00:16:58.500
(Medicine)

00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.100
How is it?

00:17:17.792 --> 00:17:20.320
(Falling Snow)

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:31.900
Tomorrow we'll head to Chaos Valley.

00:17:32.859 --> 00:17:34.420
There must be a way to save you there.

00:17:36.259 --> 00:17:37.059
Do you know

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.180
that in my heart

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.019
you're actually unique

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:42.180
and potent medicine?

00:17:49.859 --> 00:17:50.688
A Night Clan member?

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:52.859
I've never seen you before.

00:17:54.779 --> 00:17:56.220
Hua Yuying, Night Clan's Left Envoy.

00:17:56.819 --> 00:17:58.259
Please return with me, Night Deity.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.500
I'm an ordinary Night Clan member
without demonic bone.

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:06.019
You've got the wrong person.

00:18:06.619 --> 00:18:07.859
I won't return with you.

00:18:08.859 --> 00:18:09.980
Under Demon Heart Hall

00:18:10.299 --> 00:18:11.740
lies our clan's sacred spring

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:12.819
called Asura Spring.

00:18:13.299 --> 00:18:14.339
It has healing properties.

00:18:15.299 --> 00:18:17.900
Miss Bai, even if you refuse
to become the Night Deity,

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:19.900
you can still enhance your power

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:21.019
and recover there.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:26.259
In that case,

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:27.619
let's go.

00:18:29.259 --> 00:18:30.259
It's Night Clan's place.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:31.500
It's dangerous.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.420
While there's any hope,

00:18:34.019 --> 00:18:35.099
we mustn't give up.

00:18:35.859 --> 00:18:37.180
And with my cultivation level,

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:39.380
I've nothing to fear.

00:18:48.059 --> 00:18:49.380
Then I demand he accompanies me.

00:18:49.819 --> 00:18:51.019
And you must guarantee

00:18:51.859 --> 00:18:53.099
we won't be separated.

00:18:54.339 --> 00:18:55.180
Of course.

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:15.059
Hail the Night Deity!

00:19:16.259 --> 00:19:18.208
- Hail the Night Deity!
- Hail the Night Deity!

00:19:19.099 --> 00:19:20.259
I'm not the Night Deity.

00:19:21.099 --> 00:19:22.059
My name is Bai Chuli.

00:19:23.579 --> 00:19:24.779
Don't mind it, Miss Bai.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:27.220
This is Jiaotu, our Right Envoy.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.259
He'll escort you to Asura Spring.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.019
Hold.

00:19:36.259 --> 00:19:38.359
He cannot go.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:40.940
Why?

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:42.940
We agreed beforehand

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.299
we wouldn't be separated.

00:19:45.779 --> 00:19:47.140
You must understand, Miss Bai.

00:19:47.539 --> 00:19:49.779
Asura Spring is our sacred site.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.299
No outsiders may enter.

00:19:52.019 --> 00:19:54.460
I'll take this immortal to rest.

00:19:54.779 --> 00:19:56.259
Just follow Jiaotu, Miss Bai.

00:19:58.099 --> 00:19:58.700
It'll be fine.

00:20:02.339 --> 00:20:03.660
Please, Miss Bai.

00:20:13.579 --> 00:20:15.579
Immortal, this way, please.

00:20:21.339 --> 00:20:22.019
Miss Bai, please.

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.328
- Hail the Night Deity!
- Hail the Night Deity!

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.180
What are you doing?

00:20:50.339 --> 00:20:51.299
Get up quickly!

00:20:52.619 --> 00:20:54.819
For centuries,
Night Clan lacked leadership

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.339
and suffered Nine Heavens' oppression.

00:20:58.579 --> 00:21:00.299
Now that the Night Deity returns,

00:21:01.019 --> 00:21:02.660
our power shall soon multiply.

00:21:03.259 --> 00:21:06.059
Miss Bai, we implore you
to lead us against Nine Heavens.

00:21:07.859 --> 00:21:09.619
Didn't I clarify before coming?

00:21:10.099 --> 00:21:11.380
I'm only here to recuperate.

00:21:12.059 --> 00:21:13.180
If you break our agreement,

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:14.779
Chen and I will leave.

00:21:22.779 --> 00:21:24.900
You can't leave as you wish.

00:21:28.539 --> 00:21:29.339
What do you mean?

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:33.460
No.

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:35.019
Chen!

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:44.660
You distracted Chuli

00:21:45.579 --> 00:21:46.660
just to ambush me?

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:49.579
Worthy of being Sword Master.

00:21:50.299 --> 00:21:51.539
But unfortunately,

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.259
you won't survive tonight.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.779
Cease your futile efforts.

00:21:56.819 --> 00:21:58.940
Chuli will never agree
to become Night Deity.

00:21:59.819 --> 00:22:00.859
I'm taking her away now.

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.619
You can't take her away.

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.259
Sword Master, don't you want to know

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.660
why we dare challenge you

00:22:12.819 --> 00:22:14.380
despite this vast power gap?

00:22:16.859 --> 00:22:19.180
You used such underhanded tactics!

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:21.700
The Sword Master is poisoned.

00:22:21.859 --> 00:22:22.740
Attack him!

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:26.339
I know

00:22:27.299 --> 00:22:28.299
the Night Deity's return

00:22:29.539 --> 00:22:30.900
can empower the Night Clan.

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.180
So you've elaborately schemed this.

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:38.900
But if I die now,

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:40.980
you'll gain nothing.

00:22:50.259 --> 00:22:51.559
Chuli.

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:56.539
Chuli,

00:22:56.819 --> 00:22:58.220
what are you doing?

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:00.539
We finally reunited.

00:23:00.539 --> 00:23:02.539
Don't abandon me.

00:23:04.299 --> 00:23:05.420
Were you captured and forced

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:06.380
to say this?

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:07.740
No.

00:23:08.099 --> 00:23:10.420
Mr. Right Envoy treats me well.

00:23:11.019 --> 00:23:11.980
He said

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.619
Chuli would return

00:23:14.779 --> 00:23:17.740
as the Night Clan's Night Deity.

00:23:22.059 --> 00:23:24.180
Then I could gain power

00:23:24.299 --> 00:23:26.940
and heal my body.

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:32.019
Ling,

00:23:33.059 --> 00:23:34.619
but Chuli

00:23:35.059 --> 00:23:36.660
refuses the Night Deity mantle.

00:23:37.619 --> 00:23:38.859
Why?

00:23:39.099 --> 00:23:42.480
Doesn't Chuli want to live with us?

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:49.859
Where's Chen?

00:23:51.099 --> 00:23:51.776
Let me see him.

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:56.819
Wait!

00:23:58.579 --> 00:23:59.099
Chen!

00:23:59.539 --> 00:24:01.140
Mr. Wan Guchen!

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:02.900
Sir!

00:24:04.579 --> 00:24:05.220
Chen?

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:09.180
Chen, wake up. Don't scare me!

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:10.380
Lord Night Deity,

00:24:11.019 --> 00:24:12.859
this man is Nine Heavens' Sword Master,

00:24:13.059 --> 00:24:13.980
our sworn enemy.

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:14.900
He can't live.

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:16.740
While he's unconscious,

00:24:17.259 --> 00:24:18.779
we should kill him.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:21.980
He's under my protection.

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:23.420
How dare you touch him?

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.019
We wouldn't dare.

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:28.900
But we wonder

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.779
by what authority you command us?

00:24:31.339 --> 00:24:33.019
Unless you are the Night Clan's leader,

00:24:33.539 --> 00:24:35.259
we needn't obey.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.059
Don't kill Mr. Wan Guchen.

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:40.940
He's a good man.

00:24:41.019 --> 00:24:42.359
He saved us.

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:45.299
Ling,

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.579
if Chuli agrees

00:24:48.019 --> 00:24:49.140
to be the Night Deity,

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:51.660
we'll spare him.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.339
(I don't know what they'll do to Chen.)

00:24:58.299 --> 00:24:59.660
(My current strength)

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:01.880
(can't confront them directly.)

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:04.180
(Besides, my fate)

00:25:05.099 --> 00:25:07.180
(dooms me to die by Chen's hand anyway.)

00:25:08.539 --> 00:25:09.920
(Perhaps becoming Night Deity)

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:12.240
(will fulfill destiny.)

00:25:16.019 --> 00:25:16.579
Very well.

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.539
I'll assume the Night Deity mantle.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:21.819
From now on,

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:23.339
all obey my orders.

00:25:23.859 --> 00:25:24.619
Wan Guchen

00:25:25.579 --> 00:25:26.500
is not to be harmed.

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.880
As you command, Lord.

00:25:37.859 --> 00:25:39.099
But Wan Guchen remains

00:25:39.779 --> 00:25:41.339
a member of Nine Heavens.

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:43.059
His presence here

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.099
endangers our clan.

00:25:46.019 --> 00:25:46.980
What should we do?

00:25:47.819 --> 00:25:48.880
My Lord,

00:25:49.619 --> 00:25:50.420
please advise.

00:26:26.259 --> 00:26:26.940
No.

00:26:38.099 --> 00:26:38.579
Chuli.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:40.180
Chuli!

00:26:42.619 --> 00:26:43.500
You're awake, sir.

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:44.500
Good.

00:26:44.779 --> 00:26:45.819
I'll leave you now.

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:50.140
Where am I?

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:52.779
Why am I here?

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:53.660
Well,

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.539
some strange people
brought you here last night.

00:26:56.579 --> 00:26:57.700
They paid me

00:26:57.779 --> 00:26:58.500
to watch over you

00:26:58.539 --> 00:26:59.700
until you awoke safely.

00:27:10.579 --> 00:27:12.380
Hail the Night Deity's return!

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.339
Salute!

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:47.420
Wan Guchen?

00:27:47.779 --> 00:27:48.339
Chuli!

00:27:49.019 --> 00:27:49.740
Come with me.

00:27:54.299 --> 00:27:54.880
Wan Guchen!

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:01.720
You've agreed to become
the Night Deity of the Night Clan.

00:28:02.299 --> 00:28:04.779
You must sever all ties with those
from the Nine Heavens.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:07.980
Today marks your coronation ceremony.

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:09.960
We must see it through.

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.059
You agreed to become their Night Deity?

00:28:16.259 --> 00:28:16.900
Yes.

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:19.539
I did agree.

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:22.019
Leave now.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:23.680
Why?

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:27.859
They forced you, didn't they?

00:28:30.619 --> 00:28:31.339
Come with me.

00:28:33.579 --> 00:28:34.180
Chen,

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:38.140
we've exhausted every option.

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:39.980
This is the only path left.

00:28:40.579 --> 00:28:41.299
Isn't it?

00:28:47.059 --> 00:28:47.740
I'm tired.

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:50.460
Tired of clinging to hope,

00:28:51.099 --> 00:28:52.339
only to see it shatter.

00:28:53.779 --> 00:28:55.220
They've sworn not to harm you.

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:56.660
Leave quickly.

00:28:57.099 --> 00:28:57.900
I won't leave!

00:29:00.059 --> 00:29:01.099
Clinging to hope,

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:03.839
only to see it shatter repeatedly.

00:29:05.019 --> 00:29:07.059
I have been living like this
for three centuries.

00:29:07.859 --> 00:29:09.140
Don't become the Night Deity.

00:29:11.339 --> 00:29:12.980
Don't abandon me, please.

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:14.660
Chuli?

00:29:17.259 --> 00:29:18.259
I've made up my mind.

00:29:19.579 --> 00:29:21.339
Today is my ascension as Night Deity.

00:29:22.059 --> 00:29:23.059
If you don't leave now,

00:29:23.819 --> 00:29:25.339
I'll have no choice but to act.

00:29:25.579 --> 00:29:26.259
I won't go.

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.220
When I was against
the entire Nine Heavens,

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:34.980
I never retreated an inch.

00:29:36.339 --> 00:29:37.019
Today,

00:29:38.099 --> 00:29:39.940
I won't retreat either.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:41.059
Are you mad?

00:29:44.779 --> 00:29:45.980
If you don't leave now,

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:47.619
they will kill you.

00:29:47.859 --> 00:29:48.940
What does it matter?

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:51.339
Without you,

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.460
I have nothing left.

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:02.299
The hour has come.

00:30:03.539 --> 00:30:04.660
Night Deity,

00:30:05.019 --> 00:30:06.180
please accept the rites.

00:30:28.619 --> 00:30:29.220
Chuli!

00:30:35.099 --> 00:30:35.700
Chen?

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:40.339
What was that?

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:42.539
You promised not to kill him!

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:45.259
If I spare him,

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:47.619
you can't complete your ascension.

00:30:53.019 --> 00:30:54.059
Even if it means death,

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:56.900
you won't yield an inch?

00:30:58.339 --> 00:30:59.140
Without you,

00:31:02.059 --> 00:31:03.619
my existence has no meaning.

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:08.180
Stop them!

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:09.619
Don't let them escape!
