CRINGY ROMANCE

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:36.301
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION

00:00:36.384 --> 00:00:37.383
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO ACTUAL PERSONS, EVENTS,
OR BACKGROUNDS IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL

00:00:37.478 --> 00:00:38.315
ALL GUIDELINES REGARDING
THE USE OF CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS

00:00:38.398 --> 00:00:39.373
WERE STRICTLY FOLLOWED DURING FILMING

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:04.923
- Yes.
- Where are you?

00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:06.567
- I'm on my way.
- Why aren't you here yet?

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.611
I said I was coming.
I just got off work, man.

00:01:09.987 --> 00:01:11.280
Is everyone there?

00:01:11.363 --> 00:01:13.657
Even Jun-seok's here. You're the last one.

00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:16.118
So, when are you arriving?

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.121
Hello?

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:21.998
Are you there?

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:23.807
Wait.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.836
I think I just saw Seol-ha.

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.631
What? Seol-ha?

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:32.467
Wait. Which Seol-ha?

00:01:33.135 --> 00:01:34.803
Guys, he said he just saw Seol-ha.

00:01:48.484 --> 00:01:55.745
2000 SPRING

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:20.374
Guys, how is the game going?

00:02:20.457 --> 00:02:21.809
Kook Ki-bong is losing.

00:02:21.892 --> 00:02:23.310
Seriously?

00:02:23.752 --> 00:02:24.853
What?

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.863
No way. Who is this guy?

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:28.199
His name is Lim Yo-hwan.

00:02:28.282 --> 00:02:30.009
I've never seen him before. He's so good.

00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:33.070
He's got insane control
over those Marines.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.197
I'm about to go insane. I'm starving.

00:02:36.948 --> 00:02:38.200
When is Gi-hyeok arriving?

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:39.577
Am I just food to you?

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.495
- He's here.
- Food!

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:43.330
- Thanks.
- Our food is here.

00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:45.416
Food. Thanks.

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:46.709
Good work.

00:02:49.027 --> 00:02:51.212
- Let's see.
- We got sandwiches this time?

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.781
Sandwiches expire
during the afternoon shift.

00:02:53.865 --> 00:02:56.109
- Jeez.
- Hey.

00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:58.204
Why did you bring trash?

00:02:58.287 --> 00:03:00.581
I only used that twice. Give it to me.

00:03:00.664 --> 00:03:02.182
Oh, jeez.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.543
Kwon Gi-hyeok.

00:03:04.626 --> 00:03:06.937
He's the most resourceful among us.

00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:09.398
Apparently, his family was pretty wealthy,

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:13.076
but his dad fell into a huge debt
during the IMF crisis and passed away.

00:03:13.385 --> 00:03:15.654
So, his family fell on hard times
all of a sudden.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.974
He's a warm-hearted and kind guy
who still brings us our daily food

00:03:19.057 --> 00:03:21.310
while delivering newspapers

00:03:21.393 --> 00:03:23.078
and working part-time
at a convenience store.

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:26.331
Wait. You're reusing that?

00:03:26.857 --> 00:03:29.168
You're unbelievable.

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:31.337
- Min-gi.
- Yes?

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.361
- Did you know?
- Know what?

00:03:33.444 --> 00:03:35.049
Your pants are even more unbelievable.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.508
What about them?

00:03:36.908 --> 00:03:39.719
When did you buy that?
The knees are all stretched out.

00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:42.748
What's wrong with my pants?

00:03:42.831 --> 00:03:45.016
You also have pants
that are baggy at the knees.

00:03:46.335 --> 00:03:47.978
Oh, gosh. Look.

00:03:49.588 --> 00:03:52.274
This is called hip-hop.

00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:54.068
His name is Lee Gwang-jae.

00:03:54.151 --> 00:03:55.235
You know?

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:58.988
He's cheerful and outgoing,
loves hip-hop and clubbing,

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:02.576
and is the most experienced
with girls among us.

00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:06.329
He was always where the girls were,

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.553
- and when he was there,
- I'll teach you.

00:04:09.636 --> 00:04:11.501
the girls weren't.

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:15.255
I feel like going to a club tonight.

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:24.623
Shush. I think it's Seong-mi.

00:04:24.706 --> 00:04:26.458
Is it a group blind date?

00:04:26.549 --> 00:04:28.401
- Yes!
- Group date...

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.283
Hey, Seong-mi. Are they down?

00:04:32.367 --> 00:04:34.548
Jun-seok, don't you have

00:04:34.632 --> 00:04:36.259
- any other friends?
- Why?

00:04:36.551 --> 00:04:40.514
I don't think I can set your friends
up with my friends from my major.

00:04:40.597 --> 00:04:43.534
- What do you mean?
- Honestly, they're weird.

00:04:43.617 --> 00:04:47.309
The guy with blonde hair
looks too thirsty.

00:04:47.392 --> 00:04:50.799
And the guy with glasses
can't even read the room.

00:04:50.882 --> 00:04:54.460
And the other one...
I don't even know what his deal is.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.964
Don't you have any hotter friends?

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:00.008
Are you being serious right now?

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.177
Lastly, this is Noh Jun-seok.

00:05:02.494 --> 00:05:04.054
He's the owner of this rooftop room.

00:05:05.062 --> 00:05:06.665
He's the most excellent among us.

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:10.059
No, he's practically the best-looking guy
in our major,

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.938
and he's calm and easygoing,
so he's nearly perfect--

00:05:13.739 --> 00:05:14.898
Well,

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:18.443
he's not perfect in every way.

00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:22.322
Anyway, he's more loyal to us
than anybody.

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:25.575
I'm incredibly offended.

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:29.120
Who do you think you are
to judge my friends that way?

00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:31.790
Whatever. Call off the blind date.

00:05:32.541 --> 00:05:35.294
No, forget it. Crap.

00:05:36.987 --> 00:05:40.132
Jun-seok, what did you just do?

00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:42.050
I'll tolerate anything

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:44.428
but criticizing my people.

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:47.536
You should have tolerated it.

00:05:47.619 --> 00:05:49.619
He's right. And how are we your people?

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:51.726
We're just college friends.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.273
I was so looking forward
to that blind date.

00:05:57.924 --> 00:06:00.109
You still want to go on a blind date
after hearing that?

00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:02.443
- Doesn't it offend you?
- It doesn't.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.199
It doesn't. Why are you so offended?

00:06:05.282 --> 00:06:07.826
Who cares if we're offended
when we can go on a date with girls?

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:10.411
Plus, she's not exactly wrong.

00:06:11.663 --> 00:06:14.583
Min-gi, are you going to chip in?

00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:16.460
Me? What about me?

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:19.254
Don't even bother. He wasn't even
interested in the date in the first place.

00:06:19.446 --> 00:06:21.798
I would like to go on a blind date.

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:25.135
- But what's so good about a blind date?
- It is good.

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:27.012
You get to drink and play games
with girls.

00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:28.263
How fun is that?

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:31.058
We drink and play StarCraft every day.

00:06:32.334 --> 00:06:34.334
- You have a point.
- Right?

00:06:36.735 --> 00:06:39.800
Oh, it's like you guys are
still in high school.

00:06:39.883 --> 00:06:42.244
- What's the matter with him?
- Min-gi's right.

00:06:42.327 --> 00:06:43.820
Let's go to a PC cafÃ©.

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:47.015
- Seriously?
- I'm not going.

00:06:47.098 --> 00:06:48.125
Let's go.

00:06:48.208 --> 00:06:49.463
- I'm not going.
- Wait for me.

00:06:49.546 --> 00:06:50.894
- I'm not going.
- You're not?

00:06:50.977 --> 00:06:53.497
- Come on!
- I'm not going.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.290
I'm not going.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.542
Wait!

00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:58.794
This ramyeon tastes great.

00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:01.713
Fine. I'm coming. Damn it.

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:06.426
- Hey!
- Oh, no.

00:07:07.536 --> 00:07:09.888
The year was 2000, and I was 20 years old.

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:12.597
I had become a college student,

00:07:12.833 --> 00:07:15.435
but in reality, I was only a high schooler
who had just finished the entrance exams.

00:07:15.936 --> 00:07:17.980
Nothing more, nothing less.

00:07:19.698 --> 00:07:27.864
CRINGY ROMANCE

00:07:28.039 --> 00:07:29.767
I told you to send me an Overlord!

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.331
- Just wait.
- They sent a Dark Templar!

00:07:32.414 --> 00:07:34.601
- No way.
- Look!

00:07:34.684 --> 00:07:36.625
- Where is it?
- Get them!

00:07:36.708 --> 00:07:39.485
- Send some Lurkers.
- My Bunkers!

00:07:39.568 --> 00:07:42.014
- Oh, I'm dying.
- Repair it.

00:07:42.098 --> 00:07:43.488
Send me an Overlord!

00:07:43.571 --> 00:07:45.512
- Give me a minute.
- No!

00:07:45.595 --> 00:07:47.384
My Battlecruiser is up. I got them now.

00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:51.805
All I needed was these guys and StarCraft.

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:55.017
It felt like
I could live like that forever.

00:07:56.134 --> 00:07:57.136
A WARM WELCOME TO ALL OUR NEW STUDENTS

00:07:57.219 --> 00:08:00.272
At least, that's how I felt until then.

00:08:10.357 --> 00:08:12.184
HONGIN UNIVERSITY

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:30.093
- What did they say?
- They're full.

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:31.511
No empty seats.

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:33.535
What's wrong with Gyeong-tae?

00:08:33.618 --> 00:08:36.124
He said he'd set us up with dance majors.

00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:38.101
He said he didn't mean all of us.

00:08:41.588 --> 00:08:42.689
What?

00:08:43.173 --> 00:08:45.651
I already said no.

00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:47.361
So, he asked you.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.779
- That's not it.
- Korean literature!

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:51.489
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:55.227
- Good afternoon!
- Hey.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:57.203
- Freshmen?
- Yes!

00:08:57.562 --> 00:08:58.788
I just called you.

00:08:59.122 --> 00:09:00.540
- Goodbye!
- Yes.

00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:02.401
- Salute!
- Dismissed.

00:09:02.484 --> 00:09:03.710
Bye.

00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:05.086
Gosh.

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:10.049
Who were they?

00:09:10.408 --> 00:09:12.844
- No idea. Maybe they're seniors.
- Wait.

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:16.472
How did they know we were freshmen
majoring in Korean literature?

00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:19.267
- Is it that obvious?
- Min-gi.

00:09:19.376 --> 00:09:21.376
Your class is written on your jacket.

00:09:22.687 --> 00:09:24.439
Oh, right.

00:09:27.659 --> 00:09:28.943
Guys.

00:09:29.219 --> 00:09:33.615
I'm curious to know.
Are you guys proud of our major?

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:35.534
What are you getting at?

00:09:35.617 --> 00:09:38.703
Only freshmen wear
their varsity jackets at school.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.246
Do you know that?

00:09:40.872 --> 00:09:42.872
You guys are so tacky.

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:45.208
First, get wide pants.

00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:46.512
And sag them.

00:09:46.595 --> 00:09:48.171
- I should go to class.
- Wait for me.

00:09:48.363 --> 00:09:50.674
- I'm coming with you.
- I'm going to my part-time job.

00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:54.217
- What are you going to do, Min-gi?
- Me?

00:09:54.619 --> 00:09:55.913
I'm not sure.

00:09:55.996 --> 00:09:58.098
You set up a terrible schedule.

00:09:58.181 --> 00:09:59.850
Why did you leave a free period
between classes?

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:01.418
- Now you have to kill time.
- Whatever.

00:10:01.501 --> 00:10:02.936
You can stay in my room.

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:04.835
No, I have Literature 101
in the afternoon,

00:10:04.919 --> 00:10:06.231
so it's better to wait on campus.

00:10:06.381 --> 00:10:07.369
Bye.

00:10:07.452 --> 00:10:08.816
- We're leaving.
- Bye.

00:10:09.318 --> 00:10:10.323
Bye, Gi-hyeok.

00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:29.921
Korean literature major?

00:10:38.721 --> 00:10:39.931
Freshman?

00:10:48.423 --> 00:10:49.649
I asked if you were a freshman.

00:10:51.176 --> 00:10:52.611
Yes.

00:10:53.403 --> 00:10:55.739
Good. Can I see your schedule?

00:10:56.781 --> 00:10:57.907
Sorry?

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:00.952
Don't you have a timetable?
For your classes.

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:03.663
I do.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.456
My schedule.

00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:10.544
Right. My timetable. Where did I put it?

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.431
Thank you.

00:11:44.395 --> 00:11:47.373
- Why did you want my schedule?
- Right.

00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:51.044
I missed school for personal reasons.

00:11:52.337 --> 00:11:55.882
So, I have to sign up for courses now,

00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:58.509
but I don't know any of them.

00:12:04.741 --> 00:12:07.544
I see. But I'm--

00:12:08.419 --> 00:12:10.021
All done. Here you go.

00:12:14.317 --> 00:12:16.903
I copied your schedule.
Is that all right with you?

00:12:17.971 --> 00:12:19.489
Yes, I'm...

00:12:20.807 --> 00:12:23.868
Right. I'm a freshman, though.

00:12:24.535 --> 00:12:27.663
So am I. Korean literature major.
I also entered in 2000.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.424
- Do you have a cigarette?
- I don't smoke.

00:12:39.325 --> 00:12:40.593
I see.

00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:44.723
- I'll get going.
- Goodbye.

00:12:46.506 --> 00:12:47.506
Right.

00:12:48.751 --> 00:12:50.269
What's your name, by the way?

00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:53.439
I'm Seo Min-gi.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.400
Seo Min-gi.

00:12:58.444 --> 00:12:59.737
See you around, Min-gi.

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:10.623
See you around, Min-gi.

00:13:12.025 --> 00:13:13.376
See you around, Min-gi.

00:13:15.545 --> 00:13:17.005
See you around, Min-gi.

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:21.765
You were scooching down

00:13:21.848 --> 00:13:23.644
and spitting on ants
during your free period like a little kid,

00:13:23.727 --> 00:13:26.014
and a girl came up to you
and talked to you?

00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:27.432
You expect me to believe that?

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:29.767
I'm serious!

00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:34.394
Leaving room for the free period was
a great move.

00:13:34.478 --> 00:13:35.966
And wearing the varsity jacket every day.

00:13:36.049 --> 00:13:38.429
I'm also going to wear
my varsity jacket every day.

00:13:38.513 --> 00:13:40.343
- You said it was tacky.
- When did I say that?

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:43.323
Stop being dramatic.
She only copied my schedule.

00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:46.242
What do you mean, "dramatic?"
She takes the same classes as you.

00:13:46.909 --> 00:13:48.061
You'll see her every day.

00:13:48.144 --> 00:13:50.421
- What's her name, by the way?
- Right. What's her name?

00:13:51.873 --> 00:13:53.024
Oh, I never asked her that.

00:13:53.107 --> 00:13:54.650
But that's so important.

00:13:54.943 --> 00:13:58.004
He'll get to learn her name
as he takes the lectures.

00:13:58.087 --> 00:13:59.505
What matters is...

00:14:01.824 --> 00:14:02.967
Is she pretty?

00:14:04.802 --> 00:14:06.012
Well...

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:09.641
I think she's pretty.

00:14:09.724 --> 00:14:11.417
Or she's not. I don't know.

00:14:17.048 --> 00:14:18.733
Oh, she's pretty.

00:14:19.801 --> 00:14:21.027
She is pretty.

00:14:23.654 --> 00:14:25.531
She's hot.

00:14:26.683 --> 00:14:28.683
Is she? I don't know.

00:14:28.935 --> 00:14:31.663
She's freaking hot, man!

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:34.790
You're being really awkward right now.
Why do you think that is?

00:14:34.941 --> 00:14:36.693
It's because she's pretty.

00:14:36.776 --> 00:14:38.378
What's so awkward about me?

00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:39.879
- I'm not.
- Hey.

00:14:39.962 --> 00:14:41.239
Come here. Look.

00:14:41.322 --> 00:14:42.548
I'm good.

00:14:44.225 --> 00:14:47.136
Do you see how all those guys
are putting on a show?

00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:49.723
- Yes. No, thank you.
- Why do you think that is?

00:14:49.806 --> 00:14:51.516
Because she's pretty.

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:55.795
Are you sure she's in our major?

00:14:55.878 --> 00:14:57.522
Why have I never seen her?

00:14:57.605 --> 00:14:59.605
She couldn't come to school until now.

00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:00.942
Why not?

00:15:01.426 --> 00:15:03.069
I don't know why.

00:15:03.386 --> 00:15:05.205
You take that class too. Get inside.

00:15:05.288 --> 00:15:06.847
Why would I?

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:08.871
- It hasn't even started yet.
- Go in and talk to her.

00:15:08.954 --> 00:15:10.160
Talk to her about what?

00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:11.578
- Hang on.
- At least say hi to her.

00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:12.746
- And ask her what her name is.
- Stop!

00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:14.372
Just go!

00:15:16.174 --> 00:15:17.333
He's coming back out!

00:15:17.416 --> 00:15:18.500
- Push him in.
- Hey!

00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:21.170
- Hold the door.
- Hold the door.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.090
Hey, Min-gi!

00:15:26.342 --> 00:15:27.552
Hi.

00:15:27.977 --> 00:15:29.454
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:15:29.537 --> 00:15:30.680
Hey.

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.390
Hello, there.

00:15:48.906 --> 00:15:51.242
"Hello, there?" I'm such an idiot.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.661
Hello, there.

00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:57.582
So embarrassing.

00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:03.878
You're studying really hard.

00:16:06.574 --> 00:16:07.909
What--

00:16:08.659 --> 00:16:10.970
What brings you here?

00:16:11.721 --> 00:16:14.223
You're the only one I know in this class.

00:16:16.626 --> 00:16:18.269
- You're right, ma'am.
- "Ma'am?"

00:16:18.728 --> 00:16:21.314
What are you talking about?
We're both freshmen.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.523
Right.

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:24.442
You're right.

00:16:24.525 --> 00:16:27.278
What do you think about this lecture?

00:16:28.237 --> 00:16:31.323
It's a bit boring, actually.

00:16:32.558 --> 00:16:33.951
I knew it.

00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:36.287
Hey.

00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:39.499
Then, you should have told me
when I copied your schedule.

00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:41.375
That I shouldn't sign up as it's boring.

00:16:41.751 --> 00:16:44.462
This is a required course
for freshmen, though.

00:16:44.545 --> 00:16:46.213
- Is it?
- Yes.

00:16:47.548 --> 00:16:49.173
I didn't know.

00:16:53.871 --> 00:16:55.598
Oh, you didn't know.

00:16:58.226 --> 00:16:59.519
Good morning.

00:17:01.854 --> 00:17:02.938
Good morning.

00:17:07.301 --> 00:17:08.777
I know

00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:11.531
what their gazes mean.

00:17:11.614 --> 00:17:13.449
- Hey.
- No way.

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:15.159
What's going on?

00:17:18.162 --> 00:17:19.789
She's doing it.

00:17:19.872 --> 00:17:21.185
- Look.
- I'm so jealous.

00:17:21.268 --> 00:17:23.852
What about me? I want one too.

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:26.421
- Will he take it?
- Will he?

00:17:31.851 --> 00:17:33.594
- Kang Jin-hyeok.
- Yes.

00:17:34.428 --> 00:17:36.013
- Ko Su-cheol.
- Yes.

00:17:36.414 --> 00:17:38.141
- Kwon Hyeon-su.
- Yes.

00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:40.893
Kwon Seol-ha?

00:17:41.127 --> 00:17:42.270
Yes.

00:17:42.712 --> 00:17:44.230
- Kim Seok-hun.
- Yes.

00:17:44.464 --> 00:17:46.733
- Kim Hyeon-su.
- Yes.

00:17:47.049 --> 00:17:48.859
- Kim Jong-dae.
- Yes.

00:17:49.193 --> 00:17:50.737
- Kim Cheol-su.
- Yes.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.322
So, her name is Kwon Seol-ha.

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:54.324
- Yes.
- Nam Gung-min.

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:55.350
Yes.

00:17:55.433 --> 00:17:57.160
- Park Jae-yeon.
- Yes.

00:17:59.036 --> 00:18:01.914
There has been much scholarly debate

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:07.002
over the starting point
of modern Korean literary history.

00:18:07.278 --> 00:18:08.613
Some scholars point

00:18:08.696 --> 00:18:11.674
the Donghak Revolution as the beginning,

00:18:11.949 --> 00:18:15.052
- while others trace it back
- Shush.

00:18:15.853 --> 00:18:18.472
further to the Eulsa Treaty

00:18:18.831 --> 00:18:21.292
or even the Treaty of Ganghwa.

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:25.312
Others also consider events such as
the March 1st Independence Movement,

00:18:25.813 --> 00:18:28.232
the publication
of the first full-length novel,

00:18:28.382 --> 00:18:31.819
the launch of The Independent News,

00:18:31.902 --> 00:18:35.906
or the Japanese annexation of Korea
as key milestones.

00:18:40.077 --> 00:18:41.037
Hey...

00:18:41.662 --> 00:18:42.579
Hey, there...

00:18:43.548 --> 00:18:45.208
Excuse me.

00:19:11.384 --> 00:19:13.384
In Hanyang, the capital of Joseon,

00:19:13.594 --> 00:19:15.654
the first year of the project

00:19:15.997 --> 00:19:18.032
began.

00:19:19.004 --> 00:19:22.132
This project was led

00:19:22.703 --> 00:19:23.871
by the Emperor of Joseon.

00:19:24.355 --> 00:19:28.042
It was in 1896.

00:19:28.959 --> 00:19:32.196
After the March 1st Independence Movement
in 1919...

00:19:32.279 --> 00:19:33.797
Have you seen my sanitary pad?

00:19:34.073 --> 00:19:37.118
- What?
- You know, the teddy bear pouch.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.114
What? Keep looking.
Maybe you dropped it somewhere.

00:19:41.197 --> 00:19:42.515
That's weird.

00:19:44.208 --> 00:19:46.628
I've been looking, but I can't find it.

00:19:46.711 --> 00:19:48.813
In 1896...

00:19:57.013 --> 00:19:59.866
I should change schools, right?

00:20:00.282 --> 00:20:01.366
"Transfer."

00:20:03.144 --> 00:20:05.144
How am I supposed to see her again?

00:20:05.563 --> 00:20:07.563
She must think I'm a total pervert.

00:20:07.998 --> 00:20:09.751
When I'm working part-time
at the convenience store,

00:20:09.834 --> 00:20:11.169
female customers
normally don't buy sanitary pads

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.128
when it's a male cashier.

00:20:13.295 --> 00:20:14.797
- Why not?
- What?

00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:16.382
Because it's embarrassing.

00:20:17.825 --> 00:20:20.594
Gwang-jae, what should I do?
Give me some advice.

00:20:21.621 --> 00:20:24.057
Just keep her as a fond memory.

00:20:24.332 --> 00:20:26.851
At least you got to talk to a pretty girl.

00:20:27.017 --> 00:20:28.770
You're never helpful.

00:20:28.853 --> 00:20:30.688
Why don't you just be honest with her?

00:20:31.297 --> 00:20:34.675
How am I going to be honest with her?

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:37.778
Hey, Min-gi.

00:20:38.496 --> 00:20:39.864
Let's eat.

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:42.741
I-- What?

00:20:47.563 --> 00:20:48.706
Sure.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:50.291
Come on.

00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:55.713
Was that what happened?

00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:59.217
I thought you were being sweet
by getting me new ones.

00:20:59.367 --> 00:21:00.635
Well...

00:21:01.118 --> 00:21:04.263
Where did you go earlier?
Were you just skipping class?

00:21:04.722 --> 00:21:08.476
I went out to get some fresh air.

00:21:09.518 --> 00:21:12.187
Right. I also signed up for Modern Poetry.

00:21:12.412 --> 00:21:13.564
What?

00:21:13.781 --> 00:21:16.442
You got into Modern Poetry?

00:21:16.847 --> 00:21:17.943
Yes.

00:21:18.027 --> 00:21:19.529
But how?

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:22.240
I heard they never accepted
extra students,

00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:23.533
so I barely got in.

00:21:24.366 --> 00:21:26.618
I talked to the professor.

00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:29.038
I told him that I had come back late

00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:31.165
as I had to attend
my brother's funeral in the US.

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:34.960
Oh, I see.

00:21:35.461 --> 00:21:37.380
I didn't know that. I'm sorry.

00:21:37.638 --> 00:21:39.882
I had no idea.

00:21:40.392 --> 00:21:41.535
That's fine.

00:21:42.384 --> 00:21:43.552
It's a lie.

00:21:45.137 --> 00:21:46.513
I don't have a brother.

00:21:46.956 --> 00:21:48.224
I'm an only child.

00:21:56.716 --> 00:21:58.067
Thank you.

00:21:58.943 --> 00:22:00.194
I don't need the sauce.

00:22:06.809 --> 00:22:08.327
Neither does he.

00:22:10.204 --> 00:22:12.456
Trust me and try it just once.

00:22:13.032 --> 00:22:14.792
It's so good.

00:22:16.919 --> 00:22:18.295
Thank you!

00:22:29.248 --> 00:22:30.808
Why aren't you eating?

00:22:31.392 --> 00:22:32.852
Oh, this?

00:22:33.227 --> 00:22:35.062
I was going to.

00:22:40.676 --> 00:22:42.236
Trust me.

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:46.407
Eat it like this.

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:49.868
- Really?
- Yes.

00:22:50.019 --> 00:22:51.203
Here you go.

00:22:57.167 --> 00:22:59.086
What do you think? It's good, isn't it?

00:23:03.215 --> 00:23:04.633
Is it bad?

00:23:04.842 --> 00:23:06.719
Right? It's so good.

00:23:10.122 --> 00:23:11.598
Do you not smoke?

00:23:12.224 --> 00:23:13.225
No.

00:23:15.336 --> 00:23:16.562
Wait.

00:23:16.696 --> 00:23:17.939
I want black coffee.

00:23:28.557 --> 00:23:29.992
Isn't it bitter?

00:23:30.701 --> 00:23:34.246
Thanks. I usually drink espresso.

00:23:34.705 --> 00:23:35.998
"Esper?"

00:23:37.416 --> 00:23:38.584
Do you want to try it?

00:23:52.348 --> 00:23:54.725
- It's pretty bitter, right?
- Not really.

00:23:54.808 --> 00:23:56.059
It's nice.

00:23:57.311 --> 00:23:58.729
Your pinky...

00:24:03.884 --> 00:24:05.360
What about my pinky?

00:24:06.487 --> 00:24:07.989
I hear that people with artistic sense

00:24:08.072 --> 00:24:10.199
raise their pinkies like you just did.

00:24:11.116 --> 00:24:12.326
I'm jealous.

00:24:13.744 --> 00:24:15.496
You're raising your pinky too.

00:24:15.871 --> 00:24:18.791
No. I'm doing this on purpose.

00:24:18.916 --> 00:24:20.084
It doesn't naturally go up.

00:24:25.464 --> 00:24:28.008
Min-gi, open your palm like this.

00:24:28.509 --> 00:24:30.219
My palm? Why?

00:24:30.302 --> 00:24:31.845
Just open it.

00:24:39.603 --> 00:24:41.730
I knew it.

00:24:43.674 --> 00:24:46.026
Your index finger is longer
than your ring finger.

00:24:48.153 --> 00:24:49.112
It is.

00:24:49.822 --> 00:24:51.032
What about it?

00:24:52.391 --> 00:24:55.953
They say that people with such fingers
have a gentle

00:24:56.036 --> 00:24:57.454
and sensitive nature.

00:24:57.938 --> 00:24:59.665
And you don't?

00:25:00.749 --> 00:25:01.792
Measure them.

00:25:05.237 --> 00:25:07.298
Your index finger seems longer
than your ring finger too.

00:25:07.381 --> 00:25:09.383
No, my ring finger is longer.

00:25:09.466 --> 00:25:10.842
Measure them properly.

00:25:20.269 --> 00:25:21.896
Oh, you're right.

00:25:22.271 --> 00:25:23.314
Right?

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.651
I envy you.

00:25:28.986 --> 00:25:31.363
Is it really that nice?

00:25:35.351 --> 00:25:36.494
Of course, it's nice.

00:25:36.994 --> 00:25:38.463
He's such a player!

00:25:38.546 --> 00:25:39.730
He made a move on her
while acting all coy.

00:25:39.813 --> 00:25:41.707
- Gosh.
- I wouldn't call that a move.

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:43.834
You were drinking coffee
out of a vending machine,

00:25:43.917 --> 00:25:45.252
and you touched her hands.

00:25:45.461 --> 00:25:47.402
If that isn't a move,
I don't know what is.

00:25:47.485 --> 00:25:50.341
I've been keeping an eye on him,
and he never raised his pinky.

00:25:50.532 --> 00:25:52.051
- He did make a move on her.
- Hey.

00:25:52.134 --> 00:25:54.720
It only goes up momentarily
when I'm holding a cup.

00:25:55.512 --> 00:25:57.512
Anyway, Min-gi,
what do you think about her?

00:25:57.831 --> 00:25:59.541
Me? What do you mean?

00:26:02.044 --> 00:26:05.564
I only talked to her a few times, dude.

00:26:06.006 --> 00:26:08.651
It's okay to have feelings for her.
Why the fuss?

00:26:08.734 --> 00:26:10.110
I mean,

00:26:10.402 --> 00:26:13.197
it's not like I know her that well.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.724
I only talked to her a few times.

00:26:14.807 --> 00:26:16.976
There's no particular reason for me
to be into her.

00:26:17.059 --> 00:26:18.577
- Right?
- But she's pretty.

00:26:19.036 --> 00:26:20.120
He's right.

00:26:20.788 --> 00:26:21.998
Min-gi.

00:26:22.566 --> 00:26:24.083
You've never had feelings for anyone,
have you?

00:26:25.125 --> 00:26:26.376
He's onto me.

00:26:27.152 --> 00:26:28.336
Guys.

00:26:29.046 --> 00:26:31.757
I never knew you guys were like that.

00:26:31.907 --> 00:26:33.848
You're only attracted to their looks?

00:26:33.931 --> 00:26:35.094
I'm not!

00:26:35.177 --> 00:26:38.289
I'm not attracted to someone
only because of their looks.

00:26:38.372 --> 00:26:40.725
Everyone is attracted by their looks.

00:26:40.808 --> 00:26:42.143
Let's be honest.

00:26:42.501 --> 00:26:43.811
I hated the fact

00:26:44.436 --> 00:26:47.189
that I would have feelings for someone
for such a primitive reason.

00:26:47.408 --> 00:26:48.466
Anyway, good luck.

00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:50.134
I'm not that type of person.

00:26:50.217 --> 00:26:51.536
Don't forget to set us up
with her friends.

00:26:51.619 --> 00:26:53.154
Yes, good luck with her.

00:26:53.695 --> 00:26:55.947
But it's not like that.

00:27:01.078 --> 00:27:02.621
- You've got this.
- Gosh.

00:27:17.469 --> 00:27:18.428
That's no good.

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:09.588
- Hello, Professor.
- Hello, Professor.

00:28:09.671 --> 00:28:11.272
Hi, everyone.

00:28:24.703 --> 00:28:27.064
Everyone showed up today.

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:31.168
All right. Did you all enjoy your lunch?

00:28:31.276 --> 00:28:34.838
During the Goryeo Dynasty,
the Military Revolt

00:28:35.422 --> 00:28:37.883
led to the introduction
of "paegwan" literature from China.

00:28:39.034 --> 00:28:43.013
With the arrival of this literary form,
"gajeonche" began to emerge.

00:28:43.972 --> 00:28:46.791
"Gajeonche" is fictitious prose
in which objects are personified,

00:28:46.874 --> 00:28:49.227
and it would later have
a significant influence...

00:29:13.193 --> 00:29:14.920
You don't have to give me the sauce.

00:29:19.383 --> 00:29:20.676
Do you want some?

00:29:39.578 --> 00:29:40.696
Here.

00:29:42.014 --> 00:29:43.365
Thanks.

00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:49.997
This is nice.

00:30:07.808 --> 00:30:10.392
You can't help but hum, can you?

00:30:10.475 --> 00:30:11.919
When did I hum?

00:30:12.002 --> 00:30:13.604
They're practically dating, right?

00:30:13.737 --> 00:30:16.005
What? We're not in a relationship.

00:30:16.088 --> 00:30:19.109
Yes, you are.
You two are obviously a couple.

00:30:19.276 --> 00:30:22.654
You eat together, take classes together,
and do everything together.

00:30:23.062 --> 00:30:25.490
- Do we actually look like that?
- Yes.

00:30:26.016 --> 00:30:27.726
I should be more careful.

00:30:27.809 --> 00:30:29.268
I don't want other people to think that.

00:30:29.351 --> 00:30:30.954
Man, I hate you.

00:30:31.396 --> 00:30:32.789
I can't stand you.

00:30:34.166 --> 00:30:36.043
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:30:37.486 --> 00:30:38.545
Where are you off to?

00:30:38.628 --> 00:30:40.628
We're going to a PC Cafe.

00:30:43.425 --> 00:30:45.969
Did you sleep at Jun-seok's last night?

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:48.972
Yes. How did you know?

00:30:50.307 --> 00:30:51.892
It rained yesterday.

00:30:59.274 --> 00:31:01.093
If you see someone like this

00:31:01.176 --> 00:31:03.028
while you're working
at the convenience store,

00:31:03.111 --> 00:31:04.904
make sure to call me instantly.

00:31:05.197 --> 00:31:06.782
- You have my number, right?
- Yes.

00:31:07.407 --> 00:31:09.326
I heard you recently got
a special promotion.

00:31:10.227 --> 00:31:12.454
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

00:31:13.663 --> 00:31:17.983
Oh, well. I only did my job
as a public servant.

00:31:18.066 --> 00:31:20.179
I heard he played a crucial part.

00:31:20.262 --> 00:31:22.047
- Goodness.
- Awesome.

00:31:22.631 --> 00:31:25.801
No, I wouldn't call it a crucial part.

00:31:26.143 --> 00:31:28.387
Where did you get that information?

00:31:31.064 --> 00:31:33.558
A detective has

00:31:33.792 --> 00:31:37.145
something that normal people don't have.
What do you call it?

00:31:37.729 --> 00:31:39.881
Gut feeling!

00:31:39.965 --> 00:31:41.965
Something feels sketchy,

00:31:42.442 --> 00:31:45.321
and I look. And see?

00:31:45.404 --> 00:31:47.489
He's definitely a criminal.

00:31:47.723 --> 00:31:49.375
Even the one I caught yesterday.

00:31:49.516 --> 00:31:52.711
I bumped into him in an alley,
and something felt off about him.

00:31:52.794 --> 00:31:55.371
I whipped my head around and looked--

00:31:55.831 --> 00:31:59.376
Oh, my daughter! Where are you going?

00:31:59.876 --> 00:32:02.087
I told you.
I have a group project at school.

00:32:02.421 --> 00:32:05.049
Now that you're in college,

00:32:05.132 --> 00:32:08.451
you're working hard day and night.

00:32:08.534 --> 00:32:10.534
These guys are too busy

00:32:10.771 --> 00:32:12.681
fooling around in college.

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:15.768
- I'll be back, Dad.
- Bye.

00:32:16.601 --> 00:32:17.977
Stop.

00:32:22.858 --> 00:32:23.817
What?

00:32:31.992 --> 00:32:33.660
I thought you were going
for a group project.

00:32:35.162 --> 00:32:36.455
I am.

00:32:37.581 --> 00:32:38.624
So?

00:32:38.882 --> 00:32:40.166
So...

00:32:43.712 --> 00:32:45.712
If you're going to school
for a group project...

00:32:47.507 --> 00:32:48.883
What?

00:32:49.593 --> 00:32:51.011
What's up with that bag?

00:32:53.455 --> 00:32:55.182
Oh, this?

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.894
This is just a handbag.

00:32:58.977 --> 00:33:00.228
Oh, no.

00:33:03.481 --> 00:33:08.069
How can you be so careless
and get your bag all messy?

00:33:08.278 --> 00:33:10.514
What do you think
your friends will think of your dad

00:33:10.597 --> 00:33:12.241
if you show up like this?

00:33:12.324 --> 00:33:13.534
Dad!

00:33:14.117 --> 00:33:16.328
Jeez. I'm late.

00:33:16.411 --> 00:33:17.537
Bye.

00:33:18.413 --> 00:33:20.123
Okay. Don't come home too late.

00:33:20.565 --> 00:33:22.792
Always be careful around men.

00:33:22.918 --> 00:33:24.336
I get it.

00:33:30.926 --> 00:33:32.136
What are you guys doing here?

00:33:33.595 --> 00:33:37.265
Why are your hands in your pockets?

00:33:39.809 --> 00:33:41.809
- Get out of here.
- Goodbye.

00:33:47.993 --> 00:33:49.236
Hey, Ju-yeon!

00:33:50.195 --> 00:33:51.571
Are you going on a date with Gyu-cheol?

00:33:52.656 --> 00:33:54.199
I'm going to miss my bus.

00:33:54.491 --> 00:33:55.683
- See you later.
- Bye.

00:33:55.766 --> 00:33:57.766
That's insane.
Is she going to Daejeon again?

00:33:58.019 --> 00:34:01.247
- Daejeon? Why?
- I told you. Her boyfriend goes to KAIST.

00:34:02.624 --> 00:34:05.252
Oh, right. He and Jun-seok graduated
from the same high school.

00:34:05.444 --> 00:34:08.130
Isn't Daejeon pretty far?
She's going there now?

00:34:08.238 --> 00:34:11.408
Yes, I guess it takes
a little over two hours by bus.

00:34:11.633 --> 00:34:14.303
So, how long is the round trip?
She has a curfew, though.

00:34:14.386 --> 00:34:16.763
She only sees him for a couple of hours
and comes back.

00:34:17.222 --> 00:34:19.222
That's incredible. Isn't it tough?

00:34:19.474 --> 00:34:21.415
I guess she's happy
just to see him for a little while.

00:34:21.498 --> 00:34:23.019
- Goodness.
- Ju-yeon is admirable.

00:34:23.812 --> 00:34:25.022
Min-gi.

00:34:25.689 --> 00:34:27.649
That's called true love.

00:34:45.567 --> 00:34:48.253
I guess she's happy
just to see him for a little while.

00:34:51.131 --> 00:34:53.717
That's why you should never fall in love.

00:35:06.863 --> 00:35:08.863
- Good morning, senior.
- Hey, Seol-ha.

00:35:09.382 --> 00:35:11.382
What brings you to the cafeteria?
Do you need anything?

00:35:11.551 --> 00:35:14.153
- I need to make some copies.
- Copies?

00:35:14.654 --> 00:35:16.114
Do you want some snacks?

00:35:16.197 --> 00:35:18.559
- But--
- Hang on. What kinds of snacks

00:35:18.642 --> 00:35:20.869
will freshmen these days like?

00:35:24.164 --> 00:35:26.164
How much are they? Here.

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.168
Thanks for the snacks.

00:35:30.503 --> 00:35:31.796
Thank you.

00:35:33.049 --> 00:35:34.585
Enjoy them, Seol-ha.

00:35:34.675 --> 00:35:37.343
Also, just call me by my name,
not a senior.

00:35:42.149 --> 00:35:43.350
Min-gi!

00:35:43.433 --> 00:35:45.310
Oh, hey.

00:35:47.604 --> 00:35:49.147
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:35:49.606 --> 00:35:50.649
Freshman?

00:35:51.566 --> 00:35:52.650
Yes.

00:35:55.695 --> 00:35:56.738
What?

00:35:59.866 --> 00:36:02.452
Do you want this? He bought it for me.

00:36:04.079 --> 00:36:05.414
Thanks.

00:36:12.279 --> 00:36:13.505
Gi-hyeok.

00:36:13.588 --> 00:36:16.758
You're free to accept the snacks
that a senior buys you.

00:36:16.841 --> 00:36:19.761
Right? It's not a big deal, right?

00:36:20.203 --> 00:36:21.704
- So, what's the matter?
- I have no idea.

00:36:21.787 --> 00:36:23.064
Oh, gosh.

00:36:24.499 --> 00:36:25.567
Hey.

00:36:25.709 --> 00:36:27.602
What's wrong with me?

00:36:28.019 --> 00:36:29.521
Because you're into her.

00:36:31.147 --> 00:36:33.608
Jun-seok, you've never had feelings
for anybody, have you?

00:36:33.925 --> 00:36:35.610
Of course, he hasn't.

00:36:36.011 --> 00:36:38.447
Jun-seok has never had feelings
for anybody. Why?

00:36:38.911 --> 00:36:40.948
If you're handsome,
they have feelings for you

00:36:41.032 --> 00:36:42.581
before you have them.

00:36:43.893 --> 00:36:45.286
Don't be ridiculous.

00:36:46.521 --> 00:36:47.539
Listen.

00:36:48.957 --> 00:36:50.542
What you need right now is

00:36:51.209 --> 00:36:52.252
calling dibs.

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:55.088
Dibs on what?

00:36:55.363 --> 00:36:56.465
Dibs on Seol-ha.

00:36:56.548 --> 00:36:59.742
"I called dibs on Seol-ha, so back off."

00:36:59.825 --> 00:37:01.553
You need to announce it to everyone else.

00:37:01.686 --> 00:37:02.871
What...

00:37:02.954 --> 00:37:05.474
But shouldn't you inform Seol-ha
before you do that?

00:37:05.557 --> 00:37:06.750
Oh, right.

00:37:06.833 --> 00:37:08.833
You can do that. That's up to you.

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:12.064
Hey!

00:37:14.549 --> 00:37:15.608
Tomorrow!

00:37:18.695 --> 00:37:19.929
Tomorrow? What?

00:37:20.012 --> 00:37:22.515
- Glasses, everyone!
- Thank you!

00:37:22.598 --> 00:37:24.539
- Oh, man.
- All right, everyone.

00:37:24.622 --> 00:37:26.995
- Hongin University!
- Hongin University!

00:37:27.328 --> 00:37:28.353
Cheers.

00:37:28.436 --> 00:37:30.565
KOREAN LITERATURE NIGHT

00:37:31.841 --> 00:37:34.252
Seol-ha, show some manners
and finish the glass.

00:37:34.335 --> 00:37:36.171
- Let's go!
- Bottoms up, Seol-ha.

00:37:36.254 --> 00:37:37.780
- Yes.
- Seol-ha!

00:37:37.863 --> 00:37:41.009
- Bottoms up!
- Bottoms up!

00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:42.949
- Bottoms up!
- All right!

00:37:44.804 --> 00:37:48.692
- Drink it up. Chug!
- Chug!

00:37:48.775 --> 00:37:51.011
KOREAN LITERATURE NIGHT

00:37:54.673 --> 00:37:57.192
Look at all those guys
throwing themselves at her.

00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:59.360
- I'll sit there too.
- Sit down.

00:38:00.095 --> 00:38:01.513
Going there without a plan
won't get you anything.

00:38:01.596 --> 00:38:02.780
Then, what?

00:38:03.281 --> 00:38:04.365
Go

00:38:06.276 --> 00:38:07.703
and put this on her food.

00:38:07.786 --> 00:38:09.204
Stop.

00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:11.829
All right. Listen to me.

00:38:13.166 --> 00:38:16.628
One of my cousins taught me this trick.

00:38:19.964 --> 00:38:23.676
First, you get a hangover cure.

00:38:25.845 --> 00:38:28.347
And nonchalantly place it in front of her.

00:38:28.548 --> 00:38:31.435
Then, all the guys will look at you.
But you ignore them.

00:38:31.518 --> 00:38:32.936
And you say to her, unaffected...

00:38:33.019 --> 00:38:34.771
Go easy on the drinks.

00:38:35.605 --> 00:38:38.066
And you nonchalantly return to your seat.

00:38:39.259 --> 00:38:40.527
What does that make them?

00:38:41.136 --> 00:38:42.654
Just a bunch of jerks.

00:38:42.737 --> 00:38:43.905
It's game over.

00:38:48.993 --> 00:38:50.494
That's a great trick.

00:38:50.629 --> 00:38:51.538
Right?

00:38:51.621 --> 00:38:54.791
I was saving this for later
as the ultimate move.

00:38:55.333 --> 00:38:57.460
Min-gi, I'll let you use it.

00:38:57.794 --> 00:38:59.587
They're all dead now.

00:39:00.964 --> 00:39:03.008
- Go, Min-gi.
- Okay.

00:39:13.293 --> 00:39:15.293
- Punishment shot!
- Punishment shot!

00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:31.077
Freshman.

00:39:35.398 --> 00:39:36.666
What's that?

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:44.757
Saving yourself before everyone else?

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.026
You haven't served in the military yet,
right?

00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:47.886
Yes.

00:39:47.969 --> 00:39:50.555
Freshmen these days are so undisciplined.

00:39:51.723 --> 00:39:52.974
Give me that.

00:39:53.391 --> 00:39:54.475
This?

00:39:54.851 --> 00:39:57.479
- I can buy it from you, right?
- Well...

00:39:57.562 --> 00:39:59.562
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

00:40:01.524 --> 00:40:02.775
Come here.

00:40:18.833 --> 00:40:20.543
I drank it for you,

00:40:20.802 --> 00:40:22.253
so my wish is...

00:40:26.049 --> 00:40:27.217
You can drink this.

00:40:31.246 --> 00:40:33.807
Stop forcing her to drink, guys.

00:40:33.957 --> 00:40:35.957
You guys are her friends.
Can't you see she's suffering?

00:40:36.267 --> 00:40:38.645
Why don't you drink with us?

00:40:38.728 --> 00:40:40.728
- Yes. Sit with us.
- Join us.

00:40:41.439 --> 00:40:43.262
- Join us!
- Join us!

00:40:43.345 --> 00:40:44.801
- You should.
- Take that seat.

00:40:44.884 --> 00:40:46.444
- Here.
- Then,

00:40:47.178 --> 00:40:48.863
- maybe just one drink?
- Yes, join us.

00:40:50.348 --> 00:40:53.159
- Senior!
- Senior!

00:40:53.493 --> 00:40:54.828
- Senior!
- Senior!

00:40:54.911 --> 00:40:57.330
- Senior!
- What's taking you so long, man?

00:40:59.415 --> 00:41:00.667
I'm certain.

00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:03.086
He's clearly into Seol-ha too.

00:41:05.213 --> 00:41:06.698
Who is he?

00:41:07.005 --> 00:41:07.799
Kim Jae-seon.

00:41:07.889 --> 00:41:09.598
He entered in 1995. He's the president
of the broadcasting club.

00:41:09.742 --> 00:41:11.427
Remember the school broadcast
during lunch?

00:41:11.619 --> 00:41:12.846
He's the DJ
on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays.

00:41:12.929 --> 00:41:14.929
I've heard that before.
He has a great voice.

00:41:15.848 --> 00:41:17.433
That was him?

00:41:18.017 --> 00:41:18.976
No way.

00:41:19.419 --> 00:41:23.064
It's all right, Min-gi.
He's five years older, so he's old.

00:41:23.756 --> 00:41:25.191
- Don't be scared.
- I won't.

00:41:25.692 --> 00:41:26.827
No.

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:28.945
You should never take him lightly.

00:41:29.387 --> 00:41:31.280
First, he's tall and has good proportions.

00:41:31.948 --> 00:41:33.889
His looks are average,

00:41:33.972 --> 00:41:36.161
but most girls would get the appeal.

00:41:36.244 --> 00:41:37.912
- I have no idea.
- Also,

00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:40.206
- It made me so angry.
- he's a good dresser.

00:41:40.632 --> 00:41:42.292
- When I was a freshman...
- Do you see his jacket?

00:41:42.667 --> 00:41:44.419
It's from Intermezzo. That's not fake.

00:41:44.544 --> 00:41:46.880
His pants are from NIX. His shoes?

00:41:48.047 --> 00:41:49.883
- All-white Air Force 1s?
- All-white Air Force 1s?

00:41:49.966 --> 00:41:51.907
How on earth did he get them?

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:54.120
- What...
- I'm sure he doesn't have a car.

00:41:54.203 --> 00:41:56.144
I saw him driving
a Grandeur XG last time.

00:41:56.227 --> 00:41:57.833
A Grandeur XG?

00:41:57.916 --> 00:42:00.769
But that's my dream car!

00:42:01.745 --> 00:42:02.896
Sorry.

00:42:04.547 --> 00:42:07.733
Anyway, the rumor is
that his talking game is on another level.

00:42:07.942 --> 00:42:09.994
Also, apparently,
he's very humorous and funny.

00:42:10.077 --> 00:42:11.237
How did you know it was me?

00:42:16.059 --> 00:42:17.452
It's not going to work, Min-gi.

00:42:17.785 --> 00:42:19.078
It's time to let go of Seol-ha.

00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:22.498
What do you mean by "let go?"
It's not like he had her.

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:25.501
When you make a girl laugh,
it's game over.

00:42:26.669 --> 00:42:28.111
Do you see Seol-ha's face or not?

00:42:28.194 --> 00:42:29.547
He obviously fell on his back.

00:42:29.881 --> 00:42:31.132
It's way too obvious.

00:42:31.215 --> 00:42:32.383
Isn't it, Seol-ha?

00:42:33.342 --> 00:42:34.952
It's obvious, but when you go forward...

00:42:35.035 --> 00:42:37.035
He won her over already.

00:42:39.932 --> 00:42:41.058
Gosh.

00:42:41.809 --> 00:42:42.735
Min-gi.

00:42:43.127 --> 00:42:44.478
Don't be discouraged.

00:42:44.937 --> 00:42:46.313
You still have the ultimate move left.

00:42:47.182 --> 00:42:51.945
DANCE WITH DOC

00:43:04.649 --> 00:43:06.000
I, Seo Min-gi,

00:43:06.359 --> 00:43:08.169
may not be good at much, but I can sing.

00:43:08.903 --> 00:43:11.839
They called me the Kim Jang-hoon
of Class Three in high school.

00:43:12.673 --> 00:43:15.259
There was no one in my class
who could reach

00:43:15.593 --> 00:43:16.886
higher notes than I did.

00:43:16.969 --> 00:43:18.847
Jae-seon, you should sing a song.

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:20.515
No, I'm a terrible singer.

00:43:20.598 --> 00:43:22.934
But you have such a nice voice.
You should sing one.

00:43:23.017 --> 00:43:25.378
No, not today.
My throat is in bad condition.

00:43:25.461 --> 00:43:27.811
- Oh, come on.
- Maybe next time.

00:43:27.897 --> 00:43:29.023
Too bad.

00:43:40.810 --> 00:43:42.745
Jae-seon is going to sing.

00:43:43.688 --> 00:43:44.872
It's all right.

00:43:45.481 --> 00:43:48.067
THE DAY AFTER YOU LEFT

00:43:57.352 --> 00:44:03.183
How was your day today?

00:44:05.226 --> 00:44:09.147
Was everything really okay?

00:44:09.939 --> 00:44:15.862
Are you not feeling any regret?

00:44:16.763 --> 00:44:21.534
Are you already preparing for someone new?

00:44:22.159 --> 00:44:24.159
Maybe love isn't something

00:44:25.354 --> 00:44:27.006
Just anyone...

00:44:27.089 --> 00:44:28.089
Crap.

00:44:29.859 --> 00:44:31.252
- Hey.
- Oh, man.

00:44:31.335 --> 00:44:33.754
- You should sing now.
- Go ahead.

00:44:37.466 --> 00:44:39.385
What's wrong? Why did you stop?

00:44:39.468 --> 00:44:40.969
My throat hurts.

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:43.431
I had a broadcast today.

00:44:44.223 --> 00:44:45.875
THE MORE I LOVE YOU

00:44:45.958 --> 00:44:48.627
Wait. That's my favorite song.

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:50.104
Who picked it?

00:44:58.621 --> 00:45:00.114
That's great timing.

00:45:00.448 --> 00:45:01.783
It's your song, Geon.

00:45:02.408 --> 00:45:04.493
What? Have you ever seen me sing
at karaoke?

00:45:04.702 --> 00:45:07.955
- Come on.
- Isn't that your band's closing song?

00:45:08.581 --> 00:45:10.792
Gosh, are you in a band?

00:45:15.338 --> 00:45:17.590
Haven't you heard of Black Viper Snake,
one of our school's bands?

00:45:17.824 --> 00:45:19.175
Geon is the singer.

00:45:19.258 --> 00:45:21.510
He won the bronze prize
at the College Song Festival last year.

00:45:24.805 --> 00:45:26.849
Then, who picked this song?

00:45:27.308 --> 00:45:30.210
- It was Min--
- He must have stepped out.

00:45:30.293 --> 00:45:31.562
Then, turn it off.

00:45:32.355 --> 00:45:33.773
No, I'll sing it.

00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:35.984
I love this song.

00:45:36.067 --> 00:45:37.652
But I don't really know it that well,

00:45:38.052 --> 00:45:39.528
so sing with me.

00:45:41.572 --> 00:45:43.390
- Get out there now.
- Sing with her.

00:45:43.473 --> 00:45:45.473
- No, I can't.
- Go.

00:45:48.705 --> 00:45:53.193
Now I find myself

00:45:53.276 --> 00:45:55.670
Avoiding you

00:45:55.753 --> 00:46:00.883
Just like you once did to me

00:46:02.134 --> 00:46:05.096
Maybe now

00:46:05.179 --> 00:46:09.017
I've become the pain in your life

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:16.983
The more I love you

00:46:17.383 --> 00:46:20.095
The farther

00:46:20.178 --> 00:46:23.781
You drift away

00:46:23.864 --> 00:46:26.034
Fading

00:46:26.117 --> 00:46:31.289
Like a moment in the flow of time

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:34.459
Yes! Sing with me!

00:46:45.536 --> 00:46:48.181
It's a story

00:46:48.264 --> 00:46:52.643
That's grown older than my memory

00:46:53.686 --> 00:47:00.151
The way I used to look at you

00:47:01.491 --> 00:47:05.937
Now I find myself

00:47:06.073 --> 00:47:08.493
Avoiding you

00:47:08.576 --> 00:47:14.862
Just like you once did to me

00:47:14.945 --> 00:47:17.886
Maybe now

00:47:17.969 --> 00:47:21.839
I've become the pain in your life

00:47:21.922 --> 00:47:30.014
The more I love you

00:47:30.097 --> 00:47:32.976
The farther

00:47:33.059 --> 00:47:36.521
You drift away

00:47:36.604 --> 00:47:38.898
Fading

00:47:38.981 --> 00:47:44.361
Like a moment in the flow of time

00:47:44.512 --> 00:47:47.682
You said it was all

00:47:47.765 --> 00:47:51.452
Just a memory now

00:47:51.535 --> 00:47:59.544
As you turned and walked away

00:47:59.627 --> 00:48:06.158
But the more time goes by

00:48:06.241 --> 00:48:11.764
The more I love you still

00:48:13.545 --> 00:48:14.850
What happened?

00:48:16.894 --> 00:48:19.939
Why did the song turn off?
Did you turn it off?

00:48:26.821 --> 00:48:28.072
Jae-seon.

00:48:28.781 --> 00:48:30.199
Did you cancel the song?

00:48:32.493 --> 00:48:34.493
What are you talking about?

00:48:34.912 --> 00:48:37.289
Are you serious? You think I'm that lame?

00:48:39.333 --> 00:48:40.960
You frequently do that stuff.

00:48:42.878 --> 00:48:44.878
Loser.

00:48:47.299 --> 00:48:50.011
What the heck?
Is he drunk or high on drugs?

00:48:50.094 --> 00:48:51.470
Hey, Geon!

00:48:55.624 --> 00:48:57.100
Where are you all going?

00:49:11.113 --> 00:49:12.539
- We're out of here.
- Bye.

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:14.701
I should go and cool things down.

00:49:33.871 --> 00:49:36.015
Wait. We only have a minute left.

00:49:36.474 --> 00:49:38.810
Min-gi, sing something.

00:49:39.727 --> 00:49:41.727
- Hurry.
- Okay.

00:49:42.922 --> 00:49:44.482
Hurry up.

00:49:52.306 --> 00:49:54.992
Oh, A Drunken Confession?

00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:57.560
THANK YOU FOR COMING
WE HOPE TO SEE YOU AGAIN

00:49:58.621 --> 00:49:59.747
Time's up.

00:50:00.623 --> 00:50:03.084
So what? Just sing it.

00:50:03.167 --> 00:50:04.293
What?

00:50:05.169 --> 00:50:06.962
Just sing it.

00:50:08.389 --> 00:50:10.330
But there's no music.

00:50:10.413 --> 00:50:11.592
Come on.

00:50:15.137 --> 00:50:16.622
I'm actually going to sing.

00:50:18.874 --> 00:50:19.975
Sing already.

00:50:23.254 --> 00:50:24.397
Okay.

00:50:34.532 --> 00:50:36.200
Yes

00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:42.915
Maybe I'm drunk

00:50:45.626 --> 00:50:49.630
Maybe this is a mistake

00:50:50.714 --> 00:50:52.714
And maybe by morning

00:50:53.425 --> 00:50:55.886
I won't remember

00:50:56.554 --> 00:50:59.599
A thing

00:50:59.732 --> 00:51:02.560
And be filled with regret

00:51:02.643 --> 00:51:03.936
You're a good singer.

00:51:04.170 --> 00:51:09.233
But tonight

00:51:11.385 --> 00:51:15.197
There's something I have to say

00:51:16.557 --> 00:51:18.826
Even if I seem weak

00:51:19.852 --> 00:51:22.121
Don't feel bad

00:51:22.955 --> 00:51:25.875
Don't think I'm saying this

00:51:25.958 --> 00:51:29.837
Just because of the alcohol

00:51:30.813 --> 00:51:33.758
But now, I'll confess

00:51:33.841 --> 00:51:39.805
I've loved you from the very beginning

00:51:39.888 --> 00:51:45.143
This is how much I love you

00:51:45.853 --> 00:51:50.199
Even if my clumsy words

00:51:50.282 --> 00:51:53.277
Sound awkward

00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:56.262
Or unreliable

00:51:56.345 --> 00:51:59.242
I don't say them lightly

00:51:59.331 --> 00:52:02.417
This won't happen again

00:52:10.336 --> 00:52:12.421
When morning comes

00:52:16.634 --> 00:52:18.594
I'll hold you in my arms

00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:47.539
Hello? Yes.

00:52:48.248 --> 00:52:49.875
- What's up?
- Where are you?

00:52:49.958 --> 00:52:51.552
- Are you at home already?
- No.

00:52:51.635 --> 00:52:54.780
I'm not at home. I'm around.

00:52:55.089 --> 00:52:56.299
Where are you?

00:53:23.534 --> 00:53:25.036
Hey, Min-gi.

00:53:25.369 --> 00:53:26.620
Hi.

00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:29.623
You should try this.

00:53:30.541 --> 00:53:32.334
- What?
- Give it a try.

00:53:32.543 --> 00:53:34.211
But I've never done this before.

00:53:34.294 --> 00:53:35.379
What if I ruin it?

00:53:35.462 --> 00:53:37.089
There's no ruining it.

00:53:37.865 --> 00:53:39.008
You just do it.

00:53:39.458 --> 00:53:40.550
Go like this.

00:53:41.076 --> 00:53:42.260
Paint something.

00:53:43.037 --> 00:53:44.305
Right here.

00:53:44.663 --> 00:53:46.014
Paint anything.

00:53:48.792 --> 00:53:51.394
- But I'm really bad at this stuff.
- Just try it.

00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:53.063
It's really fun.

00:53:54.173 --> 00:53:55.399
But...

00:54:02.364 --> 00:54:05.617
See? I knew you'd be good at this.

00:54:07.144 --> 00:54:10.122
I knew you had that artistic sense.

00:54:12.249 --> 00:54:15.586
I told you this was just a habit.

00:54:20.074 --> 00:54:21.509
That's good. Nice!

00:54:25.679 --> 00:54:27.470
- I'll paint it with this color.
- Sure.

00:54:30.501 --> 00:54:32.603
There you go. That looks nice.

00:54:33.045 --> 00:54:34.521
I'm doing pretty well.

00:54:45.741 --> 00:54:47.034
Man.

00:54:47.685 --> 00:54:49.370
This is so fun.

00:54:50.996 --> 00:54:52.623
You have a knack for this.

00:54:53.499 --> 00:54:55.918
I only did as you said.

00:54:56.919 --> 00:54:59.797
You're really impressive, though.

00:55:02.341 --> 00:55:04.510
What made you start doing this?

00:55:07.304 --> 00:55:09.473
I just ended up doing it.

00:55:15.437 --> 00:55:17.564
- Do you want some?
- What?

00:55:18.023 --> 00:55:19.733
No, I'm fine.

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.444
It's because my lips were on it, right?

00:55:23.153 --> 00:55:24.863
Oh, no. I'd like a sip.

00:55:33.372 --> 00:55:34.790
Are you all right?

00:55:37.251 --> 00:55:39.128
What is this?

00:55:39.962 --> 00:55:41.422
Is this alcohol?

00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:43.630
Yes. It's makgeolli. Why?

00:55:44.466 --> 00:55:46.594
So, you've been carrying around...

00:55:46.677 --> 00:55:48.012
makgeolli?

00:55:48.136 --> 00:55:49.387
It wasn't milk?

00:55:49.930 --> 00:55:52.975
Who would carry milk in a bottle?

00:55:53.265 --> 00:55:54.808
That's insane.

00:55:56.670 --> 00:55:58.271
She's actually insane.

00:55:58.630 --> 00:56:01.733
So, she's been taking classes
while drinking makgeolli at school?

00:56:02.634 --> 00:56:03.885
That means she was drunk the whole time.

00:56:05.637 --> 00:56:07.697
Why does that matter?

00:56:09.183 --> 00:56:12.036
He said he shared a straw with Seol-ha.

00:56:12.953 --> 00:56:14.747
- You're right.
- Gi-hyeok.

00:56:14.830 --> 00:56:17.166
Say Min-gi sucked on the straw
that you were using.

00:56:17.249 --> 00:56:18.375
What would you do?

00:56:18.917 --> 00:56:20.418
- I would throw it away.
- Exactly. Why?

00:56:20.586 --> 00:56:23.672
Because it's gross.
Min-gi's spit is literally disgusting.

00:56:23.947 --> 00:56:25.947
But what did she do? She took

00:56:27.159 --> 00:56:28.969
the straw that Min-gi was sucking on

00:56:30.137 --> 00:56:31.388
and sucked on it herself.

00:56:31.555 --> 00:56:32.765
What do you think that means?

00:56:32.956 --> 00:56:35.768
Right? I'm not being dramatic, right?

00:56:35.851 --> 00:56:37.269
Of course not.

00:56:37.352 --> 00:56:39.437
Do you have anything else to tell us?

00:56:43.066 --> 00:56:45.360
Oh, right. There is one more.

00:56:46.428 --> 00:56:47.612
Man.

00:56:49.823 --> 00:56:51.116
The more I look at it, the better it gets.

00:56:52.034 --> 00:56:54.787
- What do you mean?
- The painting. I like it.

00:56:55.078 --> 00:56:58.581
Especially,
it's very colorful in this area.

00:56:58.999 --> 00:57:00.751
It's very spontaneous

00:57:00.834 --> 00:57:02.836
and dynamic,

00:57:03.795 --> 00:57:06.006
and it looks like it's destroying order.

00:57:06.882 --> 00:57:09.426
- You can feel that?
- Yes, I can.

00:57:10.102 --> 00:57:13.305
Well, it's not so clear, though.
It's pretty subtle.

00:57:14.264 --> 00:57:17.601
I feel like I've seen something like this
in an art magazine.

00:57:18.877 --> 00:57:21.771
Was it a Jackson Pollock?

00:57:22.564 --> 00:57:26.067
Wait. You're right. Jackson.

00:57:26.902 --> 00:57:29.404
I just got goosebumps.

00:57:29.905 --> 00:57:31.907
- Why?
- I was trying to copy

00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:33.990
- Jackson Pollock's style.
- Right?

00:57:36.328 --> 00:57:38.080
You really have a good eye.

00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:43.794
"You really have a good eye."

00:57:47.965 --> 00:57:49.800
"You really have a good eye."

00:57:55.722 --> 00:57:58.109
This guy!

00:57:58.192 --> 00:57:59.977
Why are you hitting me?

00:58:00.143 --> 00:58:02.438
This was it!

00:58:02.521 --> 00:58:04.148
What are you talking about?

00:58:04.648 --> 00:58:07.442
"You really have a good eye."

00:58:11.405 --> 00:58:13.390
You're such a pervert!

00:58:13.473 --> 00:58:15.473
- Hey!
- You're nasty.

00:58:15.559 --> 00:58:16.994
Anyway,

00:58:17.144 --> 00:58:18.746
it's a sure thing.

00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:21.373
What kind of girl touches a guy
she's not even interested in

00:58:21.456 --> 00:58:22.791
so intimately?

00:58:22.874 --> 00:58:26.420
Easygoing girls like Seol-ha do that
without putting meaning to it.

00:58:26.503 --> 00:58:28.797
You're saying
she has zero feelings for him?

00:58:30.382 --> 00:58:31.800
Now,

00:58:32.426 --> 00:58:34.053
when it comes to a man and a woman,

00:58:34.678 --> 00:58:36.388
there are only two emotions.

00:58:36.663 --> 00:58:38.473
Like and dislike.

00:58:38.749 --> 00:58:40.601
But Seol-ha does not dislike you. Why?

00:58:40.709 --> 00:58:43.895
If she had, would she have shared a straw
with you and put her arm around you?

00:58:44.104 --> 00:58:45.755
That can never happen.

00:58:45.838 --> 00:58:47.608
- Right.
- So, what does that mean?

00:58:49.151 --> 00:58:51.403
"Like." Correct!

00:58:52.446 --> 00:58:54.448
- She likes you.
- You gave me chills.

00:58:54.906 --> 00:58:56.616
I didn't know you were so logical.

00:58:56.767 --> 00:58:59.161
According to the aptitude test,
I'm more suited for the sciences.

00:59:00.412 --> 00:59:03.081
Jun-seok, what do you think?

00:59:04.166 --> 00:59:06.460
I'm not sure.
I don't know this stuff that well.

00:59:11.255 --> 00:59:15.969
But I do believe that she thinks
positively of you.

00:59:16.161 --> 00:59:17.345
That's good enough for now, right?

00:59:17.971 --> 00:59:20.098
- Do you really think so?
- Yes.

00:59:21.099 --> 00:59:23.018
Let's eat some ramyeon now.

00:59:24.227 --> 00:59:26.004
- All right.
- Eat up.

00:59:26.087 --> 00:59:28.523
Eat up, guys.

00:59:29.024 --> 00:59:30.901
With my friends cheering me on,

00:59:30.984 --> 00:59:34.697
I felt like my very first romance was
finally about to begin

00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:36.098
at the age of 20.

00:59:36.181 --> 00:59:37.824
Are you dating Seol-ha?

00:59:39.688 --> 00:59:40.688
Sorry?

00:59:42.087 --> 00:59:44.087
- Are you into Seol-ha?
- No.

00:59:47.426 --> 00:59:49.628
I was joking!

00:59:49.945 --> 00:59:52.422
It's just that you two were
always hanging out together.

00:59:53.715 --> 00:59:56.343
That's because we have the same schedule.

00:59:56.576 --> 00:59:58.928
- And we take the same classes.
- I understand.

00:59:59.137 --> 01:00:00.347
I get it.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.143
Then,

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:06.853
can you help me out?

01:00:08.839 --> 01:00:10.232
With what?

01:00:11.399 --> 01:00:12.567
You know who Sim Geon is, right?

01:00:13.051 --> 01:00:13.902
Yes.

01:00:14.136 --> 01:00:17.156
Stay right next to Seol-ha
just like you're doing now,

01:00:17.531 --> 01:00:20.075
and when you see Geon flirting with her,

01:00:20.642 --> 01:00:22.035
give me a call right away.

01:00:23.562 --> 01:00:24.746
Why?

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:29.960
I like Seol-ha.
