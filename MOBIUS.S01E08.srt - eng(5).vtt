00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.960
I know you're in there.

I've told you countless times.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.840
Your bachelor's and master's degrees

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.040
are not a match for my doctoral program.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.320

Why do you keep pestering me?

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.670
Because in

why do you want to do genetic research?

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.110
Because genetic research
can change the world.

In Guatemala, South America,
there's a bird

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.720
called the Hoopoe.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.030
It chirps once every 30 minutes.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.540
The interval is accurate to the second.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.310
That's why people call it the bird clock.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.240
In the dense forests of Africa,

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.040
there's a time-telling insect.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.430
It changes color once every hour.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.280
Locals call it the insect clock.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.280
The South African large-leaf tree

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.630

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.960
once every two hours.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.840
Trees record time
with rings in their roots.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.430
These are called annual rings.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.680
Turtle shells record the cycle of seasons.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.910
These are called seasonal rings.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.880
Paleontologists have discovered that

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.030
the calcium carbonate
secreted daily by coral polyps

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.360
forms a tiny daily ring.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.630
These daily rings accumulate into

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.030
a growth belt distinctly different
from other years.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.240
Based on the number of daily rings

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.590
in these growth belts,

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.590
we can determine

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.120
how many days were in a year.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.470
And the number of daily rings in a coral

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.240
is exactly

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.190

I've found many strange examples.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.120
Many corals have daily rings

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.520
that exceed 400 in number

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.310

What does the loop mean?

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.510
I told you before I had a special power,

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:44.790
and you said I was talking nonsense.

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:45.600
So this time I said it,

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.270
and he believed it.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:47.670
Didn't this trick reveal

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:50.070
that someone's behind all this?

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:51.300
Don't I know if someone's behind this?

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:51.890
Well,

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.600
if I knew that
you knew someone was behind this,

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.400
I wouldn't have asked like that.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:56.840
Nonsense.

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:01.790
It's hard to explain this right now.

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:03.440
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.440
Tomorrow?

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:05.910
I feel like I've heard that

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.400
many times from you before.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.110
Impossible.

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:09.960
I've definitely never said that.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:10.630
Are you sure?

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:11.360
Of course.

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:12.970
Think about it carefully.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.510
I haven't even eaten,

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:18.240
and I still have interrogations to do.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.500
What kind of questions is he even asking?

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.590
He's never said that?

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:03.750
Boss.

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:05.150
Duan Zheng just told me

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:05.910
not to give you

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.600
any more information about Ye Kun.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.910
What's going on?

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:11.170
I don't know either.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.060
Just keep investigating for now.

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:32.910
How did it go?

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:34.510
I finished the questioning.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.720
That teacher's eyes

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.860
don't look like those of a killer.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.270
His movements

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:49.870
are abnormal.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:53.130
It's probably a sign of epilepsy.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.050
He doesn't want to kill anyone.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:58.670
But as police officers,

00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:59.930
we have to take action.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.570
We can't gamble with the hostages' lives.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.510
I have a question for you.

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:16.160
It's not an interrogation.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:19.930
You also graduated from
Ivy Bay's biology department.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:20.720
Do you know

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.720
about the relationship
between Jiang Yuwen and Mo Yuanzhi?

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.050
I've heard some rumors.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.320
Before Jiang Yuwen disappeared,

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.000
he had established himself

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.720
in the field of genetic biology.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.390
I've read many of his papers.

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:34.840
Their viewpoints and methods

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.290
had some differences.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.760
I've also heard that

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:39.150
in academic circles,

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:41.030
the explanation for his disappearance

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:42.080
was suicide.

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:44.690
They just couldn't find his body.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.530
And that he set fire to the lab himself

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:48.510
with the purpose

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:50.640
of destroying his experimental data.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.080
Well...

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.480
I have another question.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:57.670
That is,

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:59.800
why did you attend
the Zhao's wedding?

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.690
The company required
all executives to attend.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:06.400
As the chief assistant,

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:08.660
I'm considered half an executive.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.310
But with everything that happened today,

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:14.310
I suppose

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:16.490
I won't need to go anymore.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:21.829
Finally,

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.160
take another careful look at this person.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.020
Do you know him?

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:36.080
The person you arrested today?

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.330
I don't know him.

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:45.200
But I feel like I've seen him
somewhere before.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:47.160
Where?

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.960
Then again, maybe I haven't.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.350
It's okay.

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:01.750
You haven't answered the question

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:02.880
I asked you earlier.

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:09.680
Which question?

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:11.440
This morning,

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.400
Highway 1–

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:14.440
how did you know in advance

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.240
that there would be an accident?

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:18.200
I didn't know.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.240
You didn't know?

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.040
I didn't know.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:21.640
If you didn't know, why were you so urgent

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.270
about making me change routes?

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:24.310
Have the driver change the route

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:26.640
and exit the highway early
at the M16 Exit.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.790
Driver, exit the highway at
the next junction.

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:31.350
But taking this route
will add a lot of extra distance.

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.610
Reroute immediately!

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.310
Because I...

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:47.270
I checked

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.200
the news this morning,

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.350
and looked at the traffic conditions,

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:50.240
so...

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.550
Well, I have a traffic police colleague

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:54.440
who told me

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.680
there was an accident ahead.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.960
So I deduced,

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.200
if you took that route, you might

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.070
be in danger.

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.790
This is just

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:03.550
a reflection of my professional skills.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.510
You're so busy,

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:10.910
why would you be paying attention
to the traffic conditions?

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.160
B-Because...

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:21.920
you were on the road.

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:28.150
How did you know I was on the road?

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:29.840
Sorry, could you repeat that?

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:30.720
Okay.

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:32.270
Alright, I'll be right there.

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:33.070
Just a moment.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.830
Okay.

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.830
All right.

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:36.350
Okay.

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:40.070
Got it.

00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:59.110
Officer Ding,

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.550
can I leave now?

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.160
What You Yuxiang said isn't true.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.490
You can investigate it.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.400
We'll definitely investigate
what needs to be investigated,

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.800
but I'd still like to hear

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.940
your side of the story.

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:13.440
You Yuxiang,

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.920
to reopen Jiang Yuwen's case,

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:17.490
did something like this.

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:18.120
Why...

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.350
Why is he convinced

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:22.440
that you're the one
who killed Jiang Yuwen?

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.480
Why he thinks so

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.590
is something you should ask him,

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:25.110
not me.

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:26.910
Because I'd like to know why too.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:29.880
Besides,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.350
Professor You Yuxiang's mental state
has never been stable.

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:34.240
This is something everyone

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.840
at Ivy Bay University knows.

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:36.550
Are you sure

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:38.200
you shouldn't first investigate
his mental wellness

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.930
before deciding
whether to believe what he says?

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.960
We'll definitely investigate
what needs to be investigated.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:45.640
Mr. Mo,

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:48.350
it's still necessary

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:49.350
for you to tell us

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:51.750
about your relationship with Jiang Yuwen.

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:54.550
Please.

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:06.720
Jiang Yuwen

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:09.550
was my PhD supervisor.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.640
He was also

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:11.720
once my idol.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.940
In my final year of doctoral studies,

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.920
he was basically treating me

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.790
as a partner,

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:22.320
not just a student anymore.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.310
I was very grateful for that.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:26.750
But I still

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:27.680
couldn't understand

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.280
his eccentric personality.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.040
Thank you, Professor Jiang.

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:48.790
In everyone's eyes,

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.520
Jiang Yuwen is a strange man.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:51.920
So,

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:54.960
when I was choosing my PhD supervisor,

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:55.960
everyone around me

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.720
was against me choosing him.

00:21:58.430 --> 00:21:59.430
But I didn't care.

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:01.550
In the field of science,

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:04.270
every successful person
is more or less a little eccentric.

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:05.160
I admired him.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:07.290
I wanted to learn from him.

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:09.610
I wanted to become as excellent as he was.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.120
I just never expected

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.770
our relationship would turn out that way.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:18.880
Professor Jiang,

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:24.410
I've contacted an academic journal.

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:26.310
They said it has passed expert review.

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:28.710
Now it's in the editor-in-chief's
final review stage.

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:29.640
They think

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.000
the research findings are cutting-edge

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:31.920
and valuable.

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:33.000
I hope

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:33.750
you can publish it with me.

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:37.950
[Author: Mo Yuanzhi]
[Supervisor: Jiang Yuwen]

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:50.550
You can leave.

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:52.350
I got it.

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:05.470
Professor Jiang.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:26.880
Professor Jiang.

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:44.810
Professor Jiang, why?

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:45.980
You're very smart,

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:48.520
but that has become your downfall.

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:49.680
You know,

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:52.480
there are no shortcuts in science.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:55.350
You're too focused
on your so-called shortcuts.

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:56.440
Sooner or later,

00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:58.490
you'll trip on that shortcut.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.200
At that moment,

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.560
I was absolutely certain

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:39.960
my idol was jealous of me.

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:41.920
Qi.

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:44.270
If one day

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.410
someone you look up to
becomes jealous of you,

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:48.680
it can only mean

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.400
you've truly succeeded.

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:57.450
Later,
I applied to have my supervisor changed,

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:00.530
but the incident happened
before I got a response.

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:38.440
Even the police couldn't find

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.590
Jiang Yuwen's body.

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:43.080
He just vanished into thin air.

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:54.720
I won't say more about the rest.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.400
You can investigate it yourselves.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.110
Anyway,

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.920
it seems that whatever I say,

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.520
you don't really believe me.

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:01.510
Look.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.350
At Ivy Bay University,

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:05.200
I only attended
a few of Professor You Yuxiang's classes.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.640
We weren't even close.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:07.830
We had no conflicts,

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:09.290
nor any mutual interests.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.070
Besides,

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.440
on the day of Jiang Yuwen's incident,

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.880
whether it's the timeline,
witness testimony

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.160
or the surveillance footage,

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.400
everything is out there.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.160
I never entered that laboratory.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.000
This Professor You Yuxiang

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.720
is still making these baseless accusations.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.440
Why?

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.510
What is he trying to do?

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:23.070
Also,

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:24.110
You Yuxiang claimed

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:25.000
I killed Jiang Yuwen,

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:25.640
right?

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:27.480
Where is Jiang Yuwen's body?

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.810
We need to prove
Jiang Yuwen is dead first.

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:38.150
I've wasted too much time today.

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:40.070
Can I leave now?

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.100
I'll have someone escort you.

00:26:58.830 --> 00:26:58.890
Later,
the police and firefighters arrived.

All their experimental data was lost.

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:10.070
Many studies had to start over.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.070
Were those students

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:14.510
including Mo Yuanzhi?

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.550
Of course.

But he was really clever.

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:18.440
He just changed his research topic

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.840
and graduated smoothly.

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:21.490
It was quite successful too.

It later became the foundation
of Moma Biotechnology.

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:26.920
So Jiang Yuwen

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.520
just disappeared like that?

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.720
Later there were rumors that he

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.920
jumped into a river and killed himself.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.720
We only found out later

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.200
that he had depression.

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:38.550

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:41.110
What was Professor You doing today?

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:42.920
He's not usually like this.

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:44.830
How could he kill in public–

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:46.560

Don't worry so much.

do you still have any documents

We handed everything to the police.

But I have photocopies.

Jiang Yuwen's disappearance 8 years ago

wasn't just a disappearance case.

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:23.200
It was murder!

is something you should ask him,

not me.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.100

why were you monitoring them?

yet they're all ruthless businessmen.

Of course, what exactly they did

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:15.880
is not my concern,

but if they harm
the Yu family's interests,

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:19.700

Was he out on a date with An Lan?

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:36.440
I'm not sure.

00:40:40.110 --> 00:40:41.190
So, Officer Ding,

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:44.070
if you find anything,

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:46.740
please let me know.

00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:55.030
You suspect I want to kill Mo Yuanzhi?

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:56.920
Yes.

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:00.070
I want to kill him.

00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:05.510
Have you ever heard this saying?

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:08.710
Every married couple in this world

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:10.340
has countless moments

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.280
when they want to kill each other.
