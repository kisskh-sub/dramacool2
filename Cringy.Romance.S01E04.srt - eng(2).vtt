Would you like to order?

00:00:45.988 --> 00:00:47.298
That's

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:50.259
not why I'm here.

00:00:55.264 --> 00:00:57.558
I have to tell you something.

00:00:59.518 --> 00:01:01.812
What are you going to do
if he asks you out?

00:01:07.718 --> 00:01:10.716
Hello, I'm Seo Min-gi who entered
Hongin University in 2000.

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:11.947
It's nice to meet you.

00:01:21.106 --> 00:01:22.666
You're pretty.

00:01:23.884 --> 00:01:25.127
I'm sorry.

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:26.920
Gosh.

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.300
You're pretty.

00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:35.885
What is he saying?

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:41.143
Actually, I've been coming here
for the last few days

00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:42.419
because of you,

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:44.938
whose name is Yun Seol-ha.

00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:46.898
Okay. What?

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.160
No, I just mean that you're pretty...
I mean,

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.945
you're super pretty.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.657
I apologize

00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:56.741
if you're offended.

00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:59.994
- Man...
- No, I'm not.

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:02.606
You weren't offended?

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.958
- It's fine.
- Really?

00:02:06.877 --> 00:02:08.345
That's such a relief.

00:02:08.502 --> 00:02:11.963
Then, can I ask you something?

00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:13.592
Sure.

00:02:17.561 --> 00:02:18.561
Can I...

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.312
Can I keep coming here?

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:27.147
What?

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.193
No, it's not like that.

00:02:32.276 --> 00:02:34.387
I mean, I often walk by this place,

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.656
and the coffee is so good,

00:02:36.948 --> 00:02:38.408
and I'm hoping

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:40.585
I can stop by only if I'm walking by.

00:02:40.668 --> 00:02:42.036
- You can come.
- Sorry?

00:02:42.463 --> 00:02:44.748
Feel free to visit anytime.

00:02:46.567 --> 00:02:48.085
Do you mean that?

00:02:48.752 --> 00:02:49.920
Yes.

00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:55.300
I'll feel free to visit anytime.

00:02:56.868 --> 00:02:57.928
But...

00:03:18.265 --> 00:03:23.579
CRINGY ROMANCE

00:03:24.896 --> 00:03:26.164
What?

00:03:26.707 --> 00:03:28.124
Is he crazy?

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.155
So, what happened next?

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.838
- That's it.
- That's it?

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:34.172
Yes.

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:37.717
- But you said he confessed his feelings.
- No, I didn't.

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:40.888
He just said that I was pretty

00:03:40.971 --> 00:03:44.016
and asked if he could visit often.

00:03:44.558 --> 00:03:45.934
That's confessing one's feelings.

00:03:46.143 --> 00:03:48.337
No, it's not.

00:03:48.545 --> 00:03:51.381
"You're pretty. I want to come here
often." What does that mean?

00:03:51.673 --> 00:03:54.259
- That's a confession.
- No, it isn't.

00:03:54.342 --> 00:03:57.554
Ask any stranger on the street.
They'll all say it's a confession.

00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:01.825
But that wasn't why I asked her.

00:04:02.017 --> 00:04:03.810
Anyway, what happened next?

00:04:03.893 --> 00:04:06.330
Next? What's supposed to happen?

00:04:06.455 --> 00:04:07.748
He didn't ask for your number?

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.609
I can't ask her for her number.

00:04:10.692 --> 00:04:11.793
She didn't say she had a boyfriend?

00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:13.628
He didn't even ask me that.

00:04:13.711 --> 00:04:16.239
Why did you even go there
early in the morning?

00:04:16.365 --> 00:04:19.301
I told you.
I just went there to be honest with her.

00:04:19.468 --> 00:04:22.596
No, not that. What was his purpose?

00:04:23.405 --> 00:04:24.848
Purpose?

00:04:25.307 --> 00:04:26.850
There was no purpose, though.

00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:28.935
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

00:04:29.027 --> 00:04:31.771
- He's a player.
- Are you stupid?

00:04:32.297 --> 00:04:33.398
What?

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:34.908
You should have told her
your honest feelings

00:04:34.991 --> 00:04:36.618
if you had gone there
because you were interested.

00:04:36.701 --> 00:04:38.701
- You're so frustrating.
- No,

00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:42.724
I didn't mean it in a romantic way.

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.143
- You know what I mean.
- Are you joking?

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.411
Are you serious?

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.289
You're telling me
you didn't imply that at all?

00:04:48.814 --> 00:04:51.625
But I didn't walk up to her for that.

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:56.546
To be honest,
she seems a bit too older than me.

00:04:56.838 --> 00:04:58.838
I doubt that she'll ever see me as a man.

00:04:59.271 --> 00:05:00.522
Above all,

00:05:00.896 --> 00:05:02.594
she has the same name as Kwon Seol-ha.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.058
I don't know. It just feels wrong.

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:10.059
You don't know what? Don't make me laugh.

00:05:10.142 --> 00:05:11.536
Save it. Stop nagging me and get out.

00:05:11.619 --> 00:05:13.271
Get off that bed. I stayed up all night,

00:05:13.354 --> 00:05:15.354
- and I'm exhausted. Move.
- No.

00:05:15.437 --> 00:05:16.863
- I'm sleepy.
- Sleep at your house.

00:05:16.947 --> 00:05:19.778
This isn't even your room.
You can't tell me what to do.

00:05:20.954 --> 00:05:22.322
This guy.

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:42.884
That's not why I'm here.

00:05:46.705 --> 00:05:48.582
I have to tell you something.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.983
Girl, you're so chirpy.

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:16.418
Are you that excited?

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.260
Of course, I am!

00:06:18.343 --> 00:06:21.214
I haven't been to the movies
in like two years.

00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:24.034
Plus, this is my first time ever
watching a late-night movie.

00:06:24.284 --> 00:06:27.053
- Gosh.
- By the way, did you know

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:29.389
that they had caramel popcorn now?

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:32.225
I'm going to try that
when I go there tonight.

00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:35.353
Yes, good for you.

00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:40.317
Wait. You're even wearing earrings?

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:45.697
Just put them back on later.
Look at that rash coming up.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.780
Mind your own business.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:23.327
HIDEOUT BAR

00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:28.306
HIDEOUT BAR

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:48.385
Sorry. The last customer won't leave.

00:07:48.577 --> 00:07:51.013
Give me a few minutes. I'll be out soon.

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:08.947
I'm asking

00:08:09.097 --> 00:08:11.908
for just one more glass of soju
with me outside.

00:08:12.017 --> 00:08:13.327
Please?

00:08:13.476 --> 00:08:15.870
You're too drunk now.

00:08:15.953 --> 00:08:18.231
Let's get up now. All right?

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:21.834
- Let's go.
- Come on now.

00:08:21.927 --> 00:08:24.671
- Come on.
- Just one more drink.

00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:26.754
Stop!

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:29.674
You seem awfully drunk already.

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:33.638
Who's this?

00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:37.142
She says she has to close the bar.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:40.144
You need to go home now.

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:42.355
- Okay?
- Are you out of your mind?

00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:45.984
Sweetie, are you all right?

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:49.487
Hey, who's that?

00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:52.574
He's just a friend.

00:08:53.041 --> 00:08:55.952
I'm sorry. Are you hurt?

00:08:56.353 --> 00:08:59.206
A friend? This is ridiculous.

00:09:00.046 --> 00:09:01.893
Do you think this is a playground

00:09:01.976 --> 00:09:03.992
where you can hang out with your friends?

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:06.571
I'm really sorry. Don't be mad.

00:09:06.654 --> 00:09:08.131
Hui-seon!

00:09:08.907 --> 00:09:10.133
Do you have any idea why

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:12.928
I chose this bar in
this dumpster of an alley

00:09:13.286 --> 00:09:15.788
over all those fancy bars in Gangnam

00:09:15.871 --> 00:09:18.043
and bought all that expensive liquor?

00:09:18.149 --> 00:09:20.694
- You need to keep that in mind.
- Mr. Park, of course, we know.

00:09:20.778 --> 00:09:22.103
We know better than anyone.

00:09:22.186 --> 00:09:24.564
We won't charge you anything today.
Please don't be mad.

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:26.647
- Please.
- Get your hands off me.

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:29.486
You think I'm broke?

00:09:31.746 --> 00:09:33.030
You!

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:35.492
Gi-hyeok!

00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:39.036
What?

00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:43.374
Sweetie, I'm so sorry.

00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:46.028
I'll drink soju with you
the next time you come.

00:09:46.111 --> 00:09:48.296
Let this one pass.

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:50.965
You promised.

00:09:51.048 --> 00:09:53.048
You're so kind, sweetie.

00:09:53.284 --> 00:09:55.595
Now, let's get your stuff
and get out of here.

00:09:55.678 --> 00:09:57.179
I'll call you a cab.

00:10:08.341 --> 00:10:11.110
This happens all the time
when you work in this field.

00:10:12.846 --> 00:10:14.614
It may look pathetic,

00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:17.532
but it's still a workplace
where you work to make money.

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:20.311
We just do it, thinking that it's work.

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:22.872
That's all.

00:10:27.277 --> 00:10:30.380
I heard you two were going to watch
a late-night movie after work.

00:10:31.214 --> 00:10:34.134
She was so thrilled
that she bragged about it the whole night.

00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:38.304
Don't be too disappointed in her.
She felt--

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:53.861
Gi-hyeok.

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:34.986
- Come with me just this once.
- But I don't want to.

00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:37.372
You might change your mind
when you're actually there.

00:11:37.455 --> 00:11:38.907
- But...
- Just this once.

00:11:39.015 --> 00:11:40.700
All right? Here it is.

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:43.370
- Just one time.
- Seriously.

00:11:43.454 --> 00:11:44.954
- Just come.
- Gosh.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.249
You can't even do your friend a favor?

00:11:48.499 --> 00:11:50.584
This kind of place isn't for me.

00:11:50.667 --> 00:11:51.752
Have you ever been to a club?

00:11:51.835 --> 00:11:54.380
You haven't,
so how do you know if it's for you or not?

00:11:54.463 --> 00:11:56.382
It's obvious, isn't it?
It's crowded and noisy.

00:11:56.658 --> 00:11:59.010
This club is packed with hot girls.

00:11:59.113 --> 00:12:02.537
There are international students
and college girls.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.082
And I won't let you waste your good looks.

00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:07.727
Come with me just this one time.
I'll pay for the tickets and drinks.

00:12:07.936 --> 00:12:09.187
Just come with me, man!

00:12:09.854 --> 00:12:11.506
Forget it.

00:12:11.589 --> 00:12:13.316
Just this one time. I beg you.

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:15.843
- But you have to dance in there.
- Gosh.

00:12:15.926 --> 00:12:18.029
- I'm not a good dancer.
- Then, don't dance.

00:12:18.638 --> 00:12:20.990
I'm actually not going to dance.
I'll just stand there.

00:12:21.073 --> 00:12:23.034
- Don't even think about making me.
- I won't.

00:12:23.184 --> 00:12:24.327
Give me the money.

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:25.954
Great.

00:12:27.038 --> 00:12:28.164
Two tickets.

00:12:58.527 --> 00:13:00.030
Get over here!

00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:01.406
Come on!

00:13:38.259 --> 00:13:40.361
- Having fun?
- Why aren't you dancing?

00:13:40.444 --> 00:13:42.071
- No, I'm not dancing.
- What?

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:43.516
Do what I do.
When it comes to a song like this,

00:13:43.599 --> 00:13:44.599
it's all about the groove.

00:13:44.682 --> 00:13:46.868
- From the top down.
- Forget it.

00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:48.787
Just try it. Like this.

00:13:49.221 --> 00:13:50.679
- Like this?
- There you go.

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:52.540
But you have to put
on an indifferent look.

00:13:52.774 --> 00:13:54.542
Yes, you got it.

00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:56.294
- Make it sensual.
- No, I don't.

00:14:01.594 --> 00:14:02.720
Jun-seok.

00:14:02.803 --> 00:14:05.595
- Yes?
- The girls behind us keep looking at us.

00:14:09.432 --> 00:14:10.433
So?

00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:11.918
Why don't we drink with them?

00:14:12.001 --> 00:14:14.646
- No, I don't want to.
- Why? I think they'll say yes.

00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:16.147
- Wait here. I'll be back.
- No!

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:17.565
Don't worry.

00:14:27.725 --> 00:14:29.076
How many are in your group?

00:14:29.727 --> 00:14:30.650
It looks like just the two of you.

00:14:30.733 --> 00:14:32.455
We're also two people.
Do you want to hang out?

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.957
Where did you leave your wings, angels?

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:36.876
What do you say?

00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:39.212
We're not so bad. Hey, Jun-seok!

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:41.723
Noh Jun-seok!

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:43.658
Noh Jun-seok!

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:46.844
Hey! Come here.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.622
He's the most handsome guy at our school.

00:14:51.274 --> 00:14:52.809
- Say hi.
- Hello.

00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:55.842
Are you two all right with tequila shots?

00:14:55.926 --> 00:14:57.814
Okay. I'll go and get them.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.635
Four shots of tequila and Sprite, please.

00:15:02.718 --> 00:15:03.986
Thanks.

00:15:04.554 --> 00:15:07.157
I told him to keep the change.

00:15:08.199 --> 00:15:10.618
So, let me guess.

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:14.330
This is your first time at a club.

00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:17.958
I come here every day.

00:15:18.109 --> 00:15:19.794
But you don't look it.

00:15:20.428 --> 00:15:21.712
So, you're a dance major?

00:15:22.405 --> 00:15:24.090
- I'm not.
- This is insane.

00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:26.676
Seriously. I got it.

00:15:27.426 --> 00:15:28.802
This one has to be true.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.805
You're not here to seduce any guys,

00:15:31.888 --> 00:15:35.184
but you're here purely to dance.
This one is true, isn't it?

00:15:44.026 --> 00:15:46.155
High-five! Okay.

00:15:46.238 --> 00:15:47.643
Yes. I'll get the shots.

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:50.450
- Here you go.
- Thank you!

00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:51.951
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

00:15:53.202 --> 00:15:55.830
I don't know if you ever tried this.

00:15:57.482 --> 00:15:59.084
Sprite...

00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:06.633
Take a shot each.

00:16:08.618 --> 00:16:11.428
Put the napkins on the table.

00:16:11.621 --> 00:16:15.141
We're going to cover the shots,
shake them, and slam them down.

00:16:15.416 --> 00:16:16.976
Hold this.

00:16:17.393 --> 00:16:19.770
Hold it like this. Hold it tight.
Don't let it spill.

00:16:20.171 --> 00:16:23.191
Shake it once and slam it down
on the count of three.

00:16:23.382 --> 00:16:26.402
Okay? One, two, three, and you slam it.

00:16:26.485 --> 00:16:28.070
On the count of three, okay?

00:16:28.153 --> 00:16:29.989
One, two, three.

00:16:32.183 --> 00:16:34.410
What is this? Awesome.

00:16:34.493 --> 00:16:37.497
All right. Cheers!

00:16:50.152 --> 00:16:51.735
Jun-seok, do you have a girlfriend?

00:16:51.826 --> 00:16:53.971
- What?
- Do you have a girlfriend?

00:16:54.705 --> 00:16:55.848
No.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.475
I don't have one either.

00:16:58.517 --> 00:17:00.377
- Give me your phone.
- What?

00:17:00.878 --> 00:17:02.396
Your phone!

00:17:03.422 --> 00:17:04.606
Right.

00:17:26.904 --> 00:17:29.131
- Okay.
- You can look at my phone too!

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:32.301
- What's that?
- You can look at my phone.

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:34.053
Okay.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.728
What is it?

00:17:48.359 --> 00:17:50.611
- Why aren't you saving my number?
- What?

00:17:50.987 --> 00:17:53.490
- Save my number!
- Okay.

00:17:58.577 --> 00:18:00.162
What was your name?

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.043
Kim Chae-yeong.

00:18:06.335 --> 00:18:08.462
Kim Chae-yeong.

00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:14.510
You know, this is the part
where we exchange numbers.

00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:16.137
Can I get your number?

00:18:16.512 --> 00:18:18.431
No, I'm good.

00:18:25.354 --> 00:18:27.231
I'll be on the stage.

00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:28.358
I'll come with you.

00:18:28.899 --> 00:18:31.026
- See you around.
- Okay.

00:18:33.204 --> 00:18:34.447
I'll call you!

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:37.200
Kim Chae-yeong!

00:18:38.684 --> 00:18:40.995
All right. I got her number.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:42.871
- Happy?
- Happy.

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:46.041
You're not interested in her, are you?

00:18:46.567 --> 00:18:48.319
- I'll call her.
- She's all yours!

00:18:48.402 --> 00:18:49.586
Great.

00:18:51.005 --> 00:18:53.174
What was the name of her friend?

00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:55.802
No clue.

00:19:52.141 --> 00:19:53.525
Welcome.

00:19:56.166 --> 00:19:59.066
What happened to your colleague last time?

00:19:59.283 --> 00:20:01.320
- He went to the Philippines for work.
- The Philippines?

00:20:01.418 --> 00:20:02.952
- Yes.
- Really?

00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:04.328
Cheers.

00:20:11.611 --> 00:20:15.916
SEONGJIN DAILY

00:20:24.006 --> 00:20:25.614
SEONGJIN DAILY

00:20:25.698 --> 00:20:27.976
- Thanks.
- No problem.

00:21:37.722 --> 00:21:40.575
L'ATELIER DE MONET

00:21:45.137 --> 00:21:46.263
Welcome.

00:21:50.017 --> 00:21:51.602
He's never come back since, has he?

00:21:52.937 --> 00:21:55.148
- No.
- Who?

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:57.775
What do you mean, "Who?"

00:21:58.776 --> 00:22:00.361
Who are you talking about?

00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:03.489
I should fill up the water bottle.

00:22:05.349 --> 00:22:06.742
It's strange.

00:22:07.076 --> 00:22:09.520
He should have already come by
to show himself

00:22:09.603 --> 00:22:11.747
or make another move,
but he hasn't shown up since.

00:22:13.566 --> 00:22:15.109
Maybe he's no longer interested.

00:22:16.068 --> 00:22:18.670
Or he's just busy.

00:22:20.172 --> 00:22:23.217
No matter how hard I think about it,
he's such a player.

00:22:23.717 --> 00:22:25.260
He got you worrying.

00:22:25.878 --> 00:22:28.055
He looked so naive, though.

00:22:28.272 --> 00:22:32.710
L'ATELIER DE MONET

00:22:49.076 --> 00:22:50.494
Hello, Yong-taek.

00:22:51.495 --> 00:22:52.621
Hi, Yeo-jin.

00:22:53.873 --> 00:22:56.501
- It's been a while.
- What brings you here all of a sudden?

00:22:56.609 --> 00:22:59.337
I had a meeting nearby, so I stopped by.

00:23:00.671 --> 00:23:02.671
I said I'd stop by,
but it took me so long.

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:05.968
You've got
a cozy and charming coffee shop.

00:23:06.176 --> 00:23:07.552
Thank you.

00:23:11.432 --> 00:23:13.432
- Have you been well, Seol-ha?
- Yes.

00:23:13.851 --> 00:23:17.063
Wait. I'll get you some coffee.
Talk to him.

00:23:23.177 --> 00:23:26.071
So, how's your job search going?

00:23:27.223 --> 00:23:28.366
It's fine.

00:23:30.768 --> 00:23:32.161
You're so cold.

00:23:32.828 --> 00:23:34.413
Don't you feel bad for the guy you dumped?

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:39.084
So, is there a company in mind?

00:23:40.502 --> 00:23:42.921
Or I could recommend you
to a good company.

00:23:43.547 --> 00:23:46.592
You're an experienced professional
who made it to team leader at our company.

00:23:46.826 --> 00:23:48.386
You call that experience?

00:23:48.552 --> 00:23:51.096
Of course. What else would you call it?

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.890
Here's your coffee.

00:23:54.016 --> 00:23:57.019
- Right. Thanks for the coffee.
- Here.

00:24:00.773 --> 00:24:02.483
You use hard-roasted coffee beans,
don't you?

00:24:03.659 --> 00:24:04.985
It's not exactly tart either.

00:24:05.553 --> 00:24:07.738
It's just
that most customers dislike tartness.

00:24:09.165 --> 00:24:13.475
Right. Korean people
still don't get coffee.

00:24:14.812 --> 00:24:17.248
Still, you need to differentiate yourself

00:24:17.506 --> 00:24:19.066
to get ahead of others and survive.

00:24:19.149 --> 00:24:22.669
The main drink in our shop is
a latte, so...

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.880
Right. I see.

00:24:26.131 --> 00:24:27.883
Still, this feels wrong.

00:24:28.968 --> 00:24:31.554
I'll put in a good word for you.

00:24:31.704 --> 00:24:33.139
- Sorry?
- This place

00:24:33.222 --> 00:24:36.058
has a large roastery,
and they roast the beans themselves.

00:24:36.141 --> 00:24:38.644
- We can't exactly afford those.
- No, give me a minute.

00:24:39.812 --> 00:24:41.105
Just wait.

00:24:42.756 --> 00:24:44.900
Hey, it's me, Yong-taek.

00:24:45.442 --> 00:24:48.487
You know, it's about your coffee.

00:24:48.737 --> 00:24:50.030
The one I said was good last time--

00:24:50.514 --> 00:24:53.500
Yes, from Brazil.

00:24:53.726 --> 00:24:56.746
Yes. What's the supply price for those?

00:24:59.331 --> 00:25:00.999
Eight dollars per kilogram?

00:25:04.278 --> 00:25:05.421
Just a second.

00:25:06.714 --> 00:25:07.924
What's the price of your current one?

00:25:08.073 --> 00:25:10.175
It's 4.70 dollars.

00:25:12.603 --> 00:25:16.181
My sister opened a coffee shop.

00:25:16.765 --> 00:25:18.141
Yes, my actual sister.

00:25:18.684 --> 00:25:21.145
You can supply those
for four dollars, right?

00:25:22.688 --> 00:25:26.609
Come on. Do it for me.

00:25:28.193 --> 00:25:31.196
Deal. You bet.

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.156
All right.

00:25:33.724 --> 00:25:35.325
How about a round of golf this weekend?

00:25:35.826 --> 00:25:38.078
Okay. Thank you.

00:25:39.747 --> 00:25:42.375
You really don't have to do this.

00:25:42.524 --> 00:25:43.750
It's all right.

00:25:43.984 --> 00:25:46.128
I also helped him out a lot.

00:25:46.362 --> 00:25:47.589
What are good connections for?

00:25:47.672 --> 00:25:50.007
We can help each other out.

00:25:50.883 --> 00:25:53.969
Do you need anything else?

00:25:54.219 --> 00:25:56.680
You've done more than enough. Thanks.

00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:59.141
Okay.

00:26:00.209 --> 00:26:01.769
Thanks for the coffee.

00:26:03.496 --> 00:26:05.940
- I'll see you again.
- Bye, Yong-taek.

00:26:17.534 --> 00:26:18.535
He's gone.

00:26:20.629 --> 00:26:22.122
Did you see that?

00:26:22.623 --> 00:26:24.333
Now, I get what you mean.

00:26:25.175 --> 00:26:27.175
It's suffocating.

00:26:27.553 --> 00:26:31.298
I used to think it was so cool
and reliable when he did that.

00:26:34.994 --> 00:26:37.513
Given the kind of guy he is,
coming all the way here must mean

00:26:37.846 --> 00:26:40.724
- he wants to try again with you.
- He said he just stopped by.

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:42.559
Don't be ridiculous.

00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:44.770
What about you?

00:26:44.962 --> 00:26:47.189
You have absolutely zero feelings for him?

00:26:47.922 --> 00:26:49.699
If I had even the tiniest bit of love
for him,

00:26:49.783 --> 00:26:51.401
I wouldn't have broken up.

00:26:53.303 --> 00:26:55.155
You look so mild,

00:26:55.831 --> 00:26:58.033
yet you can be really firm at times.

00:26:59.493 --> 00:27:01.286
There's an Overlord on your three.

00:27:01.395 --> 00:27:03.080
- Overlord.
- I know that.

00:27:03.163 --> 00:27:04.289
Gosh.

00:27:04.873 --> 00:27:06.583
Why are your hands so slow?

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:08.376
Whatever.

00:27:08.777 --> 00:27:11.421
Wait. I got a reply from Chae-yeong.

00:27:16.885 --> 00:27:17.969
- What did she say?
- What?

00:27:18.052 --> 00:27:21.139
Sorry, I just saw your text.
I went home fine that night.

00:27:21.357 --> 00:27:25.352
"You never replied,
so I thought you were ignoring me."

00:27:25.686 --> 00:27:27.563
"What are you doing right now?"

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:30.649
"Want to meet at Blue Monkeys later?"

00:27:36.013 --> 00:27:38.933
Are you going to Blue Monkeys tonight?
Gwang-jae says he's going.

00:27:39.016 --> 00:27:40.267
I'll come if you're coming.

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:42.350
What if she replies in like an hour?

00:27:42.578 --> 00:27:43.788
Or tomorrow.

00:27:44.705 --> 00:27:46.457
Don't ignore my text!

00:27:51.862 --> 00:27:53.422
Is the signal weak
because it's a rooftop room?

00:27:58.952 --> 00:28:00.952
Let's go to Blue Monkeys.

00:28:01.035 --> 00:28:02.847
Please?

00:28:07.561 --> 00:28:08.729
No way.

00:28:13.133 --> 00:28:14.581
I never wrote her back.

00:28:14.664 --> 00:28:16.278
I was ignoring all her text messages.

00:28:19.531 --> 00:28:20.615
Why wouldn't you?

00:28:21.658 --> 00:28:22.826
What do you mean?

00:28:25.521 --> 00:28:27.788
Tell her you're coming to Blue Monkeys!

00:28:27.871 --> 00:28:29.399
You're so slow. I'll play for you.

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:31.877
Tell her that the drinks are on us.

00:28:32.754 --> 00:28:35.305
Why don't you ask her to set you up
with one of her friends?

00:28:35.388 --> 00:28:36.423
You want me to ask her for you?

00:28:37.616 --> 00:28:38.884
Idiot.

00:28:38.967 --> 00:28:40.344
- What's that?
- Nothing.

00:28:40.911 --> 00:28:43.263
Don't be shy, dude.

00:28:43.539 --> 00:28:46.333
- I'll open it.
- No, I got it.

00:28:47.751 --> 00:28:48.769
All right.

00:28:51.964 --> 00:28:53.274
You got it.

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:57.319
I did it.

00:29:04.476 --> 00:29:05.869
Welcome.

00:29:07.563 --> 00:29:08.705
Hello.

00:29:10.415 --> 00:29:12.459
- Hello.
- Would you like to order?

00:29:12.542 --> 00:29:15.295
THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV

00:29:16.546 --> 00:29:19.299
I'll have an iced Americano.

00:29:19.449 --> 00:29:20.884
- Sure.
- Hey,

00:29:20.993 --> 00:29:22.553
why didn't you come back sooner?

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.265
She's been quietly waiting for you--

00:29:27.516 --> 00:29:29.360
She can be mischievous.

00:29:29.751 --> 00:29:31.603
Your coffee will be ready soon.
Ignore her.

00:29:31.686 --> 00:29:33.146
- Pick a table.
- Here.

00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:39.653
Ask him for his number.

00:29:42.087 --> 00:29:44.831
- Ask him.
- Stop.

00:29:49.813 --> 00:29:51.273
She's been waiting?

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:53.083
For me?

00:30:21.662 --> 00:30:22.863
Amazing.

00:30:24.932 --> 00:30:27.993
- Daddy!
- There's my little girl.

00:30:49.556 --> 00:30:51.333
- Soju, why are you at home?
- What?

00:30:51.416 --> 00:30:52.726
Aren't you going on a date with Gyu-cheol?

00:30:53.643 --> 00:30:55.687
He came down with a cold.

00:30:55.796 --> 00:30:57.106
Really?

00:30:57.714 --> 00:31:00.150
Shouldn't you go to him
with a bowl of porridge?

00:31:00.776 --> 00:31:03.278
He said he'd take some pills and sleep.
Where were you, by the way?

00:31:03.403 --> 00:31:05.071
- Me?
- Yes.

00:31:08.225 --> 00:31:09.701
Jun-seok.

00:31:10.118 --> 00:31:12.579
- Your dad came by.
- My dad?

00:31:12.788 --> 00:31:16.250
Yes, he had to do something in Seoul
and visited, I guess.

00:31:17.501 --> 00:31:18.877
He wanted me to give you this.

00:31:19.069 --> 00:31:22.464
- What is it?
- You can open it yourself.

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:25.634
It's your birthday soon.

00:31:26.034 --> 00:31:28.345
He told you to buy what you needed
with that.

00:31:29.538 --> 00:31:31.373
Jun-seok,

00:31:31.456 --> 00:31:34.735
I'm going on a business trip to Busan
on your birthday.

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:38.906
I'll cook seaweed soup and braised ribs,

00:31:39.147 --> 00:31:41.566
so make sure
to give him a birthday meal, okay?

00:31:42.818 --> 00:31:44.695
- Okay.
- I'm fine, though.

00:31:44.828 --> 00:31:47.155
It was your dad's request.

00:31:47.597 --> 00:31:49.198
He even gave me money for the meat.

00:31:49.825 --> 00:31:51.644
- Okay.
- Just because it's vacation,

00:31:51.727 --> 00:31:53.078
don't sleep in.

00:31:53.161 --> 00:31:54.705
Make sure you prepare
a proper birthday meal.

00:31:54.896 --> 00:31:57.690
- All right.
- Those darn comic books.

00:31:57.773 --> 00:31:59.500
You're always reading them.

00:32:11.304 --> 00:32:12.597
Oh, I dozed off.

00:32:28.238 --> 00:32:30.866
- Where's...
- Seol-ha went home.

00:32:32.017 --> 00:32:36.038
- Shoot.
- Try Hongik High across the street.

00:32:49.368 --> 00:32:51.178
- Pass!
- Hey!

00:32:59.695 --> 00:33:03.018
Dear Yun Seol-ha. We won't be proceeding
with your application for this role.

00:33:03.102 --> 00:33:06.519
Thank you for applying, but we've decided
to move forward with someone else.

00:33:06.602 --> 00:33:10.020
- We regret to inform you...
- Unfortunately, you were not selected...

00:33:10.104 --> 00:33:13.281
We appreciate your interest
and wish you continued success.

00:33:45.273 --> 00:33:46.316
No!

00:33:46.657 --> 00:33:48.234
Watch out!

00:33:58.745 --> 00:34:00.038
Are you all right?

00:34:00.121 --> 00:34:02.716
- Sorry about that.
- I'm okay.

00:34:02.799 --> 00:34:04.417
- Sorry.
- That's fine.

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.086
Are you okay? Oh, no.

00:34:09.489 --> 00:34:11.549
- I'm fine.
- It must have hurt.

00:34:11.684 --> 00:34:13.885
- Why don't you...
- I'm okay.

00:34:16.012 --> 00:34:18.890
- How's your head?
- It's okay.

00:34:19.082 --> 00:34:21.768
Don't worry. I've got a thick skull.

00:34:22.894 --> 00:34:24.270
- Sorry?
- What?

00:34:31.152 --> 00:34:32.312
- What?
- Wait.

00:34:32.395 --> 00:34:34.280
- Did you scrape your knee?
- No.

00:34:34.363 --> 00:34:35.476
- It's fine.
- No.

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.408
Don't touch that. You might get a scar.

00:34:37.491 --> 00:34:39.410
- Oh, what do we do?
- Don't worry.

00:34:39.493 --> 00:34:42.163
- Wait here.
- It's okay, though.

00:34:42.439 --> 00:34:44.958
- Wait here!
- But...

00:34:46.568 --> 00:34:48.003
But it's no big deal.

00:34:51.673 --> 00:34:53.673
I got you an ointment.

00:34:53.756 --> 00:34:55.427
- I'm fine, though.
- Not at all.

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:57.262
You'll get a scar. You need to apply this.

00:34:58.263 --> 00:35:01.725
- It's only a little blood.
- You have to apply medicine.

00:35:39.763 --> 00:35:41.098
Hey.

00:35:43.792 --> 00:35:45.394
Do you like fruity soju?

00:35:47.354 --> 00:35:48.522
Sorry?

00:36:00.283 --> 00:36:01.534
Right.

00:36:07.666 --> 00:36:09.985
No way. This is really good.

00:36:10.068 --> 00:36:12.504
This is soju? Are you sure it's not juice?

00:36:12.879 --> 00:36:16.299
Right? I'm not a heavy drinker,
but I can drink a whole bottle of this.

00:36:16.591 --> 00:36:18.426
I've never tried this before.

00:36:18.927 --> 00:36:20.262
How much is it?

00:36:21.572 --> 00:36:23.818
PINEAPPLE, 1,000ML, 12 DOLLARS

00:36:25.642 --> 00:36:27.102
Twelve dollars?

00:36:28.211 --> 00:36:31.147
To be honest, it's way too expensive.
Right?

00:36:33.274 --> 00:36:35.985
No. I guess the fruits are in season.

00:36:37.195 --> 00:36:38.613
I can't come here that often either.

00:36:39.331 --> 00:36:41.033
It tastes good, though. Cheers.

00:37:39.416 --> 00:37:40.788
I'm going to the bathroom!

00:37:41.082 --> 00:37:42.055
Okay!

00:37:47.793 --> 00:37:48.819
- Gwang-jae!
- Yes?

00:37:48.917 --> 00:37:50.560
- I'm getting off the stage!
- Okay!

00:38:08.953 --> 00:38:11.080
- What are you doing here?
- Pardon?

00:38:11.164 --> 00:38:13.374
Why are you sitting here all by yourself?
Come and dance with us.

00:38:14.859 --> 00:38:17.070
Well, no reason.

00:38:17.153 --> 00:38:20.882
I see. What was your name, by the way?

00:38:23.259 --> 00:38:25.703
This is our second time seeing each other.

00:38:25.787 --> 00:38:27.290
We should at least know
each other's names.

00:38:27.373 --> 00:38:28.516
I'm Lee Gwang-jae.

00:38:28.606 --> 00:38:30.683
Gwang for "insane" and Jae for "talent."
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:38:34.921 --> 00:38:36.397
I'm Yeon-jeong.

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:40.193
- Oh Yeon-jeong.
- Oh, Yeon-jeong!

00:38:40.276 --> 00:38:41.819
Oh Yeon-jeong!

00:38:41.986 --> 00:38:43.279
You have a pretty name.

00:38:47.058 --> 00:38:48.910
But...

00:38:49.686 --> 00:38:52.539
how do you know Chae-yeong?

00:38:58.153 --> 00:38:59.629
There comes Chae-yeong.

00:39:01.548 --> 00:39:03.341
Great. I'll see you again.

00:39:12.517 --> 00:39:15.353
You run five kilometers a day?

00:39:15.862 --> 00:39:18.398
That's impressive.

00:39:22.218 --> 00:39:25.655
Why did you start running so much?

00:39:29.809 --> 00:39:31.244
I'm not sure.

00:39:33.204 --> 00:39:34.747
No reason.

00:39:35.623 --> 00:39:36.707
No reason?

00:39:37.108 --> 00:39:38.209
Yes.

00:39:40.595 --> 00:39:42.088
Haven't you ever felt that way?

00:39:42.822 --> 00:39:46.284
Sometimes, you just want to run.

00:39:52.732 --> 00:39:54.350
You won't understand.

00:39:58.229 --> 00:39:59.272
You're...

00:40:00.356 --> 00:40:02.149
so impressive.

00:40:03.359 --> 00:40:04.735
There's nothing impressive about that.

00:40:09.599 --> 00:40:12.493
That reminds me.

00:40:14.062 --> 00:40:17.624
I promise I'm not saying this
just to flatter you.

00:40:18.191 --> 00:40:19.292
Okay.

00:40:21.694 --> 00:40:23.087
Never mind.

00:40:23.796 --> 00:40:25.965
Jeez. What is it?

00:40:29.135 --> 00:40:31.679
Oh, I can't. You'll be way too flattered.

00:40:32.013 --> 00:40:34.557
Don't be silly. Tell me what it is.

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:37.310
Do you know how beautiful you are?

00:40:39.629 --> 00:40:41.731
That's enough. Stop.

00:40:43.024 --> 00:40:45.443
Be honest with me.

00:40:45.635 --> 00:40:49.030
You know you're pretty, don't you?

00:40:49.214 --> 00:40:50.298
Be honest.

00:40:50.698 --> 00:40:52.325
I know you know.

00:40:55.645 --> 00:40:57.497
You have good eyesight.

00:40:58.164 --> 00:41:00.917
No, I don't think I do.

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:04.820
I never imagined
that you'd be 26 years old.

00:41:04.903 --> 00:41:06.172
I thought...

00:41:06.923 --> 00:41:08.923
you'd be 22 at best.

00:41:09.284 --> 00:41:11.970
I should get a new pair of glasses.

00:41:14.289 --> 00:41:16.558
What else do you want to drink?

00:41:16.707 --> 00:41:18.907
This one? Or this one?
Order whatever you want.

00:41:18.991 --> 00:41:20.603
No, I told you.

00:41:20.687 --> 00:41:23.356
I didn't say that just to please you.

00:41:24.273 --> 00:41:25.608
That came from the bottom of my heart.

00:41:25.691 --> 00:41:27.651
- I genuinely think so.
- Okay.

00:41:28.236 --> 00:41:30.071
- I understand.
- Gosh.

00:41:31.781 --> 00:41:33.366
I'm going to the bathroom.

00:41:53.511 --> 00:41:55.179
I'll catch up with you.

00:41:57.974 --> 00:41:59.100
Seol-ha.

00:42:08.676 --> 00:42:10.676
Jun-seok, it's going insane on the stage.

00:42:10.929 --> 00:42:13.615
- Come with me. Let's watch.
- Gosh.

00:42:14.282 --> 00:42:15.450
Come on.

00:42:15.534 --> 00:42:17.993
- You have to check it out. It's so hot.
- Stop pushing me.

00:42:18.076 --> 00:42:20.076
- Let's go.
- I don't want to.

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.127
- Did you see that?
- I'm so jealous.

00:42:26.544 --> 00:42:29.589
- Gosh.
- Man, I'm jealous.

00:42:46.856 --> 00:42:48.856
They know how to party, right?

00:42:48.939 --> 00:42:51.069
Man.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:55.114
Are you jealous?
You can do it too if you want.

00:43:00.411 --> 00:43:02.330
This is wild!

00:43:09.545 --> 00:43:11.046
What are you doing here?

00:43:19.347 --> 00:43:20.932
Jun-seok.

00:43:21.608 --> 00:43:23.608
You're out of your mind.

00:43:40.351 --> 00:43:41.744
All right.

00:43:46.733 --> 00:43:48.501
Who were you here with?

00:43:50.486 --> 00:43:52.486
He's just...

00:43:53.156 --> 00:43:54.340
What?

00:44:22.268 --> 00:44:24.495
Wait. Who's this?

00:44:29.917 --> 00:44:31.961
Don't tell me he's your boyfriend.

00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:34.839
He's not, right?

00:44:36.407 --> 00:44:39.218
- Let's go, Min-gi.
- There's no need.

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:41.012
I'll go. Sit.

00:44:49.162 --> 00:44:50.521
Who is he?

00:44:52.181 --> 00:44:53.941
He's my ex-supervisor.

00:44:54.425 --> 00:44:55.985
I see.

00:44:57.804 --> 00:44:59.948
Why was he using the non-honorifics
to you?

00:45:02.366 --> 00:45:04.368
He was also a senior in college.

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:15.132
So what's with that look on your face?

00:45:17.949 --> 00:45:19.050
What look?

00:45:23.454 --> 00:45:24.764
Is he...

00:45:29.936 --> 00:45:31.187
Is he...

00:45:43.366 --> 00:45:44.784
a boomer?

00:45:45.701 --> 00:45:46.869
What?

00:45:47.311 --> 00:45:49.955
I heard there were boomers at companies.

00:45:50.289 --> 00:45:53.709
People who overwork their subordinates

00:45:53.793 --> 00:45:56.253
and pick on them.
He's one of them, right?

00:45:56.637 --> 00:45:57.796
Yes.

00:45:58.030 --> 00:45:59.965
I knew it.

00:46:00.324 --> 00:46:02.324
I could tell that he was a boomer
from his face.

00:46:02.718 --> 00:46:05.262
- Man.
- Let's go home now.

00:46:05.406 --> 00:46:06.556
Okay.

00:46:14.197 --> 00:46:15.924
TOTAL: 125 DOLLARS

00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:22.488
I was going to pay.

00:46:24.307 --> 00:46:25.909
Thank you.

00:46:26.909 --> 00:46:29.120
- You sat by the window, right?
- Yes.

00:46:29.353 --> 00:46:31.697
- Someone already paid for you.
- Excuse me?

00:46:33.291 --> 00:46:34.626
He did.

00:46:47.013 --> 00:46:48.223
Thank you.

00:46:49.098 --> 00:46:50.516
He's a great guy.

00:46:51.459 --> 00:46:52.894
Come again!

00:46:53.711 --> 00:46:55.711
Is he rich?

00:46:56.339 --> 00:46:58.298
Who is he to pay
for other people's drinks?

00:46:58.381 --> 00:46:59.776
Our bill was like 130 dollars.

00:47:00.443 --> 00:47:03.363
- I know, right?
- Maybe he's interested in you.

00:47:03.779 --> 00:47:05.197
What are you talking about?

00:47:07.408 --> 00:47:08.479
Right.

00:47:08.563 --> 00:47:11.663
Then, he wouldn't have paid 130 dollars
when you were with a guy.

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:14.916
He paid for your drinks
and put his hand up so nonchalantly.

00:47:15.416 --> 00:47:17.043
I'm jealous of guys like him.

00:47:18.294 --> 00:47:19.670
You're jealous of him?

00:47:20.212 --> 00:47:21.338
Of course, I am.

00:47:21.756 --> 00:47:23.132
That's all pretense.

00:47:23.625 --> 00:47:26.761
So what if it's pretense?
He just looked awesome to me.

00:47:28.729 --> 00:47:29.847
What?

00:47:34.769 --> 00:47:36.187
Never mind.

00:47:36.663 --> 00:47:38.064
What's wrong?

00:47:38.939 --> 00:47:40.357
Didn't you sense it?

00:47:41.467 --> 00:47:44.445
It's all manipulation.
He's making you feel like a fool.

00:47:45.362 --> 00:47:47.990
All right. Why are you yelling at me?

00:47:51.869 --> 00:47:54.789
- I'm going home.
- Seol-ha.

00:47:54.981 --> 00:47:56.207
Seol-ha!

00:47:56.707 --> 00:47:57.817
But...

00:48:03.906 --> 00:48:05.090
Seol...

00:48:13.933 --> 00:48:14.959
Jun-seok.

00:48:15.351 --> 00:48:18.771
I only met her in that club today.

00:48:19.206 --> 00:48:22.983
We drank and danced,
and it just led to that.

00:48:23.442 --> 00:48:24.735
Is that right?

00:48:25.386 --> 00:48:28.030
- Then, I'll go and ask her.
- Wait!

00:48:33.311 --> 00:48:35.121
What, man?

00:48:39.233 --> 00:48:40.751
Actually...

00:48:41.502 --> 00:48:43.004
Gosh.

00:48:45.381 --> 00:48:47.618
It just kind of happened.

00:48:47.702 --> 00:48:49.677
I got to know her by chance,

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:52.221
- and we ended up hanging out--
- Save it.

00:48:54.457 --> 00:48:55.850
You need to end things with Ju-yeon.

00:48:56.267 --> 00:48:58.267
Don't you dare try two-timing her.

00:48:58.678 --> 00:49:01.480
No, Jun-seok. I'll end it with that girl.

00:49:02.006 --> 00:49:05.484
You know better than anyone
how much I love Ju-yeon.

00:49:07.027 --> 00:49:08.403
You see,

00:49:08.821 --> 00:49:10.740
it's our first anniversary soon.

00:49:11.432 --> 00:49:13.868
She's so excited about our trip.

00:49:13.951 --> 00:49:15.951
How could you do that, knowing that?

00:49:22.418 --> 00:49:24.128
End things with her as soon as possible.

00:49:24.545 --> 00:49:25.963
Don't let Ju-yeon find out.

00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:29.091
If she ever finds out,

00:49:30.743 --> 00:49:32.928
- you're dead to me.
- Okay.

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:36.682
Wipe that lipstick on your lips...

00:49:37.792 --> 00:49:39.560
What a scumbag.

00:49:41.796 --> 00:49:44.524
Thanks, Jun-seok.

00:49:45.591 --> 00:49:46.775
Thank you!

00:49:54.241 --> 00:49:55.409
Get out of here.

00:50:05.970 --> 00:50:07.797
I just don't get it, though.

00:50:08.505 --> 00:50:10.340
Gyu-cheol has the best grades
in the whole school,

00:50:10.674 --> 00:50:13.719
is a model student, and is good-looking.

00:50:14.078 --> 00:50:15.438
So why would he want to talk to you?

00:50:15.521 --> 00:50:17.521
Why the long introduction?

00:50:21.110 --> 00:50:22.269
Nice to meet you.

00:50:22.686 --> 00:50:24.313
I'm So Ju-yeon.

00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:28.651
Hi, Ju-yeon.

00:50:30.302 --> 00:50:32.863
Yes, Gyu-cheol.

00:50:47.553 --> 00:50:49.338
Gyu-cheol asked me to be his girlfriend.

00:50:51.048 --> 00:50:52.174
What?

00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.220
Seriously?

00:50:56.495 --> 00:50:59.557
He's got quite the guts.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.226
So, what are you going to do?

00:51:04.587 --> 00:51:06.564
I'm not sure what to do yet.

00:51:09.909 --> 00:51:11.402
Can I be his girlfriend?

00:51:12.845 --> 00:51:13.946
What?

00:51:16.031 --> 00:51:18.575
Would you be all right
if I dated Gyu-cheol?

00:51:21.053 --> 00:51:22.246
No.

00:51:24.206 --> 00:51:25.416
Why not?

00:51:28.277 --> 00:51:31.739
He's smart and has
a bright future ahead of him.

00:51:31.822 --> 00:51:34.174
If you interrupt his studies--

00:51:36.118 --> 00:51:38.137
You're really pushing your luck.

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:41.556
I ought to...

00:52:21.288 --> 00:52:23.015
But it's understandable.

00:52:23.098 --> 00:52:24.958
He's only 20 years old, after all.

00:52:26.085 --> 00:52:27.561
I don't know.

00:52:28.604 --> 00:52:30.356
Maybe I was too drunk.

00:52:32.007 --> 00:52:33.800
I lost my temper out of the blue.

00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:36.195
Why on earth did I do that?

00:52:36.695 --> 00:52:39.807
He doesn't even know your backstory.
He must have been flustered.

00:52:40.207 --> 00:52:43.452
If you had told him he was your ex,
he might have understood.

00:52:45.396 --> 00:52:46.956
What if he's too upset to come back here?

00:52:50.042 --> 00:52:51.543
Then, it's over, I guess.

00:52:52.503 --> 00:52:55.531
I'm not exactly in the situation
to worry about that.

00:52:57.616 --> 00:52:59.176
You're so cold-hearted.

00:52:59.551 --> 00:53:02.721
What was on your mind when you told him
Yong-taek was your ex-supervisor?

00:53:03.289 --> 00:53:05.233
Nothing was on my mind.

00:53:06.484 --> 00:53:08.484
It's not entirely false.

00:53:26.286 --> 00:53:27.796
- Dad wanted me to bring this to you.
- Hey.

00:53:28.147 --> 00:53:29.290
What is it?

00:53:30.558 --> 00:53:33.085
Oh, it's curry! Nice.

00:53:34.486 --> 00:53:36.588
Gwang-jae, get up. We got curry.

00:53:36.922 --> 00:53:38.465
Gosh, it stinks.

00:53:38.757 --> 00:53:40.217
What did you guys do last night?

00:53:42.678 --> 00:53:45.222
We went to Blue Monkeys last night.

00:53:45.305 --> 00:53:46.473
Blue Monkeys?

00:53:47.141 --> 00:53:48.626
- The club?
- Yes.

00:53:49.101 --> 00:53:50.477
You guys even go to clubs now?

00:53:51.687 --> 00:53:53.105
What a delinquent.

00:53:55.023 --> 00:53:58.218
You think only delinquents go to clubs
or something?

00:53:58.610 --> 00:54:00.237
You should come with us next time.

00:54:00.487 --> 00:54:04.182
I'll take you to the clubs
from Gangnam, Itaewon, to Hongdae.

00:54:04.516 --> 00:54:06.785
No, thanks. Gyu-cheol would throw a fit
if he found out.

00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:10.372
- Your loss.
- Let's eat.

00:54:13.083 --> 00:54:14.918
- Man, that looks good.
- Great.

00:54:23.886 --> 00:54:27.064
This is insane!
Your dad's curry is my comfort food.

00:54:27.306 --> 00:54:28.933
That's weird.

00:54:30.292 --> 00:54:31.435
What is?

00:54:32.478 --> 00:54:34.355
Why won't Gyu-cheol pick up his phone?

00:54:35.981 --> 00:54:37.191
I bet he's still asleep.

00:54:38.050 --> 00:54:39.485
But it's so late.

00:54:40.219 --> 00:54:41.695
Is he that sick?

00:54:42.366 --> 00:54:44.476
He's at his parents' house in Seoul
because it's the vacation.

00:54:44.559 --> 00:54:45.914
Don't be too concerned.

00:54:46.767 --> 00:54:48.369
You know his home phone number, right?

00:54:49.144 --> 00:54:50.704
- Yes.
- Call his house.

00:54:51.205 --> 00:54:53.749
- No, that's going too far.
- Just call him.

00:54:53.832 --> 00:54:55.251
I don't want to.

00:55:21.051 --> 00:55:22.694
Hello, ma'am.

00:55:22.928 --> 00:55:24.530
Yes, it's Jun-seok.

00:55:25.764 --> 00:55:27.280
How have you been?

00:55:28.684 --> 00:55:30.119
Yes, I've been great.

00:55:32.104 --> 00:55:34.581
Can you put Gyu-cheol on the phone?

00:55:35.524 --> 00:55:37.084
He's not at home.

00:55:37.835 --> 00:55:40.254
He said he was staying out last night
and hasn't come home yet.

00:55:41.004 --> 00:55:42.631
Why don't you try his cellphone?

00:55:43.882 --> 00:55:46.243
Oh, okay.

00:55:46.452 --> 00:55:47.720
Stay healthy, ma'am.

00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:49.388
Bye.

00:55:50.931 --> 00:55:52.307
Why? What did they say?

00:55:52.666 --> 00:55:53.934
What?

00:55:54.752 --> 00:55:56.896
I think he's really sick. She said
he went back to bed after breakfast.

00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:58.314
Really?

00:56:03.502 --> 00:56:06.071
Oh, right. Who was that guy last night?

00:56:07.239 --> 00:56:09.324
Gosh, that's so gross.

00:56:12.603 --> 00:56:13.704
Here.

00:56:16.123 --> 00:56:17.875
- Who was he?
- What?

00:56:18.333 --> 00:56:21.419
You know, you talked to him
for a long time outside of the club.

00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:27.018
Just a friend from high school.

00:56:27.159 --> 00:56:29.303
Oh, okay. I was just curious.

00:56:29.595 --> 00:56:30.846
A friend from high school? Who?

00:56:31.889 --> 00:56:33.057
You don't know him.

00:56:33.957 --> 00:56:35.392
You have a friend that I don't know?

00:56:36.084 --> 00:56:37.143
Who is he?

00:56:37.352 --> 00:56:39.145
You think you know all my friends?

00:56:40.647 --> 00:56:43.525
- So, who is he?
- Why are you so curious all of a sudden?

00:56:47.029 --> 00:56:48.447
I wasn't that curious.

00:56:48.989 --> 00:56:50.989
But I'm starting to get curious
because of your reaction.

00:56:52.367 --> 00:56:54.077
It's just a friend. He's Gyu--

00:56:55.154 --> 00:56:56.204
He's...

00:56:56.872 --> 00:56:58.248
Gyun-tae.

00:56:58.415 --> 00:57:00.751
You don't know him.
We're not even that close.

00:57:00.943 --> 00:57:02.586
Oh, Gyun-tae!

00:57:03.337 --> 00:57:05.464
- I don't know him.
- Anyway,

00:57:05.547 --> 00:57:06.866
he knew how to party.

00:57:06.949 --> 00:57:09.118
He was hugging this girl on stage

00:57:09.201 --> 00:57:10.636
- and kissing--
- Hey!

00:57:10.902 --> 00:57:12.053
What?

00:57:14.031 --> 00:57:16.559
- Just eat your food.
- I am eating.

00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:18.769
No way. In front of everyone?

00:57:18.852 --> 00:57:20.604
There are tons of people like him
at the club.

00:57:21.313 --> 00:57:22.856
It's a total jungle.

00:57:23.131 --> 00:57:24.399
It's practically the Amazon jungle.

00:57:24.482 --> 00:57:26.401
Have you done that before?

00:57:29.905 --> 00:57:30.989
Let's eat.

00:57:32.282 --> 00:57:33.492
So, you haven't.

00:57:38.455 --> 00:57:39.748
I understand.

00:57:40.048 --> 00:57:42.876
L'ATELIER DE MONET

00:57:48.256 --> 00:57:50.383
If you're so concerned,
why don't you give him a call?

00:57:51.151 --> 00:57:54.555
Oh, I'm not that worried. I'm going home.

00:57:55.164 --> 00:57:57.016
- Bye.
- Good night.

00:58:03.105 --> 00:58:04.231
Seol-ha.

00:58:09.428 --> 00:58:10.904
What are you doing here?

00:58:18.537 --> 00:58:20.497
How long have you been standing here?

00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:28.589
It's raining. Come inside.

00:58:29.648 --> 00:58:31.633
I'm sorry.

00:58:33.719 --> 00:58:34.887
What?

00:58:35.929 --> 00:58:39.641
I thought hard about it when I got home.

00:58:41.001 --> 00:58:43.520
I thought about why you were so angry.

00:58:44.730 --> 00:58:45.898
But...

00:58:47.691 --> 00:58:50.444
I wasn't being so considerate.

00:58:52.621 --> 00:58:56.491
I didn't even know how much you suffered
at work because of him,

00:58:57.784 --> 00:59:00.453
and I was too much of a child to say
that he was cool

00:59:00.829 --> 00:59:02.247
in front of you.

00:59:06.376 --> 00:59:08.503
I'm sorry. Truly.

00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:16.886
Did you eat?

00:59:29.165 --> 00:59:32.026
You've been waiting for me
without eating all this time?

00:59:32.402 --> 00:59:33.570
Yes.

00:59:38.934 --> 00:59:40.577
Drink with me.

00:59:53.465 --> 00:59:54.800
Are you...

00:59:55.609 --> 00:59:56.844
no longer mad at me?

01:00:01.064 --> 01:00:03.766
Didn't it make you upset?

01:00:04.367 --> 01:00:05.393
Me?

01:00:05.977 --> 01:00:07.145
Why would it?

01:00:08.355 --> 01:00:11.925
I mean, I was the one
who left you out of nowhere.

01:00:12.342 --> 01:00:13.860
So, why are you apologizing?

01:00:16.154 --> 01:00:17.322
Well,

01:00:18.698 --> 01:00:20.283
you were upset,

01:00:21.309 --> 01:00:22.368
so I apologized.

01:00:30.694 --> 01:00:31.920
Have some of this too.

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:33.755
- Careful.
- Gosh.

01:00:34.322 --> 01:00:36.341
- Don't you need to eat?
- Eat up.

01:00:37.884 --> 01:00:39.369
I'll pour you a drink.

01:01:03.894 --> 01:01:05.996
- Welcome.
- Do you want soju or beer?

01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:07.581
Pick whatever you want.

01:01:14.212 --> 01:01:16.840
- TP.
- Excuse me?

01:01:17.048 --> 01:01:19.217
TP. This Plus.
Don't you know the cigarette?

01:01:19.701 --> 01:01:21.469
Right. Okay.

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:32.105
You need to pay for it first.

01:01:32.714 --> 01:01:34.274
I'm going to pay with all the other stuff.

01:01:40.664 --> 01:01:43.450
- Are you all right, ma'am?
- Are you okay?

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:45.952
- Come here.
- I'm so sorry.

01:01:47.493 --> 01:01:49.516
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:51.208
This place is too cramped.

01:01:51.883 --> 01:01:55.545
- Oh, what do we do?
- Don't worry. That's his job.

01:01:56.179 --> 01:01:57.714
I'm really sorry.

01:01:57.948 --> 01:01:59.508
Just check us out first.

01:02:00.117 --> 01:02:03.554
- Okay.
- Gosh. Are you sure you're not hurt?

01:02:03.662 --> 01:02:05.180
Yes, I'm fine.

01:02:05.789 --> 01:02:07.733
- Oh, no.
- Your clothes are all wet.

01:02:07.816 --> 01:02:09.267
This is so annoying.

01:02:10.252 --> 01:02:14.156
You know, you still need to pay
for the broken beer.

01:02:18.118 --> 01:02:19.152
What did you just say?

01:02:19.611 --> 01:02:20.779
Say that again.

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:23.240
- Babe.
- Don't.

01:02:25.116 --> 01:02:26.743
But she almost got hurt.

01:02:30.246 --> 01:02:32.623
Then, I won't charge you for the beer.

01:02:33.241 --> 01:02:34.500
Hey.

01:02:35.001 --> 01:02:38.129
Hey. Look at me.

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:41.341
Do you think I'm broke?

01:02:41.466 --> 01:02:42.934
Stop it, babe.

01:02:43.017 --> 01:02:44.552
You'd better straighten up,
you piece of shit,

01:02:44.635 --> 01:02:46.096
before I pound your face in.

01:02:46.913 --> 01:02:48.306
Stop swearing.

01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:51.100
Come again?

01:02:51.793 --> 01:02:53.228
Stop swearing.

01:02:54.029 --> 01:02:56.281
This little part-timing bastard...

01:02:56.364 --> 01:02:57.866
- Come outside.
- Let's just go.

01:02:57.949 --> 01:03:00.135
- Come outside, bastard.
- Don't do it.

01:03:00.402 --> 01:03:02.112
Come here.

01:03:02.195 --> 01:03:03.404
What did you say to me?

01:03:03.487 --> 01:03:05.474
- Say it again, you piece of shit.
- Babe!

01:03:05.557 --> 01:03:07.618
You prick. Say that again.

01:03:07.826 --> 01:03:10.104
Hey, say that to me again.

01:03:10.187 --> 01:03:11.497
You little prick.

01:03:11.947 --> 01:03:15.083
- Little punk. Put your head up.
- You scumbag!

01:03:17.010 --> 01:03:18.628
Get your hands off him!
