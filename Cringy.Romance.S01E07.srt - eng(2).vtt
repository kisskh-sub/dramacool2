00:00:55.992 --> 00:00:57.568
- I'll take him home.
- What?

00:00:58.896 --> 00:01:00.176
Good night! Bye!

00:01:27.586 --> 00:01:28.623
Hello.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.370
I'm so sorry.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.927
- Ung-cheol.
- I got a call from Se-yeong.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.012
Sorry for your trouble.

00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:36.305
It's all right.

00:01:38.557 --> 00:01:39.683
Hey, Hui-seon!

00:01:40.083 --> 00:01:41.752
Have a good life!

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:42.894
Be happy!

00:01:42.977 --> 00:01:44.104
Get inside.

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.714
- Take care. I'm sorry.
- Good night.

00:01:45.797 --> 00:01:46.898
What are you doing outside?

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.272
Are you serious?

00:02:29.925 --> 00:02:30.943
Gi-hyeok.

00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:32.845
Jun-seok.

00:02:32.928 --> 00:02:33.987
Did you drink?

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:36.114
- Get up.
- Hey, Jun-seok.

00:02:36.197 --> 00:02:37.641
Jun-seok,

00:02:37.724 --> 00:02:39.724
I didn't mean anything to her.

00:02:40.397 --> 00:02:41.421
What did you say?

00:02:41.505 --> 00:02:43.505
It's not like we're dating.

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:46.416
Right, Jun-seok?

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:50.379
There's nothing going on between us.

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:54.632
Nothing at all.

00:02:56.618 --> 00:02:57.719
That way,

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.830
it's more convenient for each other.

00:03:04.293 --> 00:03:06.293
It's more convenient.

00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:09.106
Right, Jun-seok?

00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:23.620
- Yes.
- These guys...

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:25.622
It's more convenient.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.984
It makes it easier for both of us,
right, Jun-seok?

00:03:29.068 --> 00:03:31.211
- All right. Get up.
- Right?

00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:33.797
It's more convenient, isn't it?

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.632
It's all right.

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:36.716
Jun-seok.

00:03:59.431 --> 00:04:01.174
- Is there anything inside?
- What?

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:04.870
Oh, there were two bottles of water,

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:06.079
so I couldn't decide which to drink.

00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:27.309
- Let's go.
- Yes.

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:52.083
You know,

00:04:52.275 --> 00:04:53.293
about...

00:04:53.627 --> 00:04:54.670
last night,

00:04:54.861 --> 00:04:56.754
- we were so drunk--
- I'm sorry,

00:04:56.863 --> 00:04:58.548
but I have a summer class.

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:00.425
I'll go first.

00:05:01.218 --> 00:05:02.636
Right. Okay.

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:07.974
See you!

00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:21.738
SEJONG MOTEL

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:31.706
It's Lee Gwang-jae

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.168
A million and 20 roses, baby

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:41.883
What's the problem?

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:43.927
I'm going to my part-time job.

00:05:44.369 --> 00:05:45.512
Is something wrong?

00:05:46.415 --> 00:05:47.472
Have some ramyeon.

00:05:54.421 --> 00:05:55.564
What's the problem with you?

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:57.136
Don't bother him.

00:05:59.676 --> 00:06:01.653
- Did you fight with Seol-ha?
- It wasn't a fight!

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:02.821
She unilaterally--

00:06:04.556 --> 00:06:06.032
Forget it.

00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:09.019
Are you going to keep being that way?

00:06:09.102 --> 00:06:10.954
I still can't believe it.

00:06:12.263 --> 00:06:14.522
See?

00:06:14.605 --> 00:06:15.996
It was her fault,
yet she never even left a text,

00:06:16.079 --> 00:06:17.210
saying she was sorry.

00:06:17.752 --> 00:06:18.962
Of course.

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:23.300
She was the one in the wrong,
and she just left like that.

00:06:23.617 --> 00:06:25.076
She should be so ashamed right now.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.037
That's why I'm telling you
to call her first.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.514
Why would I call her first?

00:06:32.932 --> 00:06:33.948
Min-gi.

00:06:34.436 --> 00:06:36.730
What if she actually breaks up with you?

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:38.048
Don't be stupid.

00:06:43.428 --> 00:06:45.113
But she was the one--

00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:47.615
Call her. Now.

00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:58.710
Fine. I'll be the generous one

00:06:59.144 --> 00:07:00.920
and do her kindness.

00:07:02.021 --> 00:07:03.021
Here it goes.

00:07:17.754 --> 00:07:19.898
The number you've dialed is
currently turned off.

00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:21.981
Your call will be directed to voicemail.

00:07:22.064 --> 00:07:24.302
Charges will apply after the beep.

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:25.987
She's not picking up?

00:07:34.396 --> 00:07:35.497
Jun-seok.

00:07:35.772 --> 00:07:37.791
- Do you want to hear an awesome story?
- What is it?

00:07:39.776 --> 00:07:40.835
I think I did it last night.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.401
Did what?

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:44.881
I'm no longer a boy.

00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:53.681
What?

00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:57.101
What do you expect me to do
when he's like that?

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:02.313
Whatever. You talk to him.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.068
Take it.

00:08:14.753 --> 00:08:15.829
Seol-ha.

00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:19.457
I said I'd call you later.

00:08:22.377 --> 00:08:23.587
Can we

00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:25.714
meet for a second?

00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:28.423
I just need some time alone.

00:08:31.999 --> 00:08:33.017
"Alone?"

00:08:36.207 --> 00:08:37.225
You want to be...

00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:39.645
alone?

00:08:39.836 --> 00:08:40.854
Yes.

00:08:45.342 --> 00:08:46.401
You really want to be...

00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:48.528
alone?

00:08:53.542 --> 00:08:54.910
You wish...

00:08:56.494 --> 00:08:57.829
to be alone?

00:08:58.647 --> 00:08:59.915
Min-gi.

00:09:04.836 --> 00:09:05.879
I can't...

00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:09.716
even see you for just a minute, right?

00:09:11.826 --> 00:09:13.826
Because you need some time alone.

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:18.642
Fine. Come out.

00:09:23.317 --> 00:09:24.223
Did she say yes?

00:09:45.877 --> 00:09:47.796
Why do you want to be alone?

00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:52.967
Can't we get through this together?

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:57.097
It's not that.

00:09:58.056 --> 00:10:00.642
I need some time by myself
in situations like this.

00:10:02.627 --> 00:10:05.897
We can be there for each other
in hard times.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.733
In this kind of situation,

00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:11.778
I need to be left alone, Min-gi.

00:10:16.741 --> 00:10:18.618
I guess I'm of no help to you.

00:10:25.275 --> 00:10:26.376
Then, what about me?

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:29.988
Do I have to keep waiting
until you're not mad anymore?

00:10:30.071 --> 00:10:31.506
Until you feel better?

00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:33.299
Why do you only think about yourself?

00:10:33.382 --> 00:10:35.802
No, why do you only think about yourself?

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:39.181
I'm saying that I'll do anything for you.

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:44.019
But...

00:10:44.727 --> 00:10:45.937
Never mind.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.191
What are you doing?

00:10:55.914 --> 00:10:58.700
I'm sorry. Please forgive me this once.

00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:06.165
I'm really sorry.

00:11:06.424 --> 00:11:07.708
Don't do this.

00:11:07.791 --> 00:11:10.253
I'm so sorry.

00:11:10.987 --> 00:11:14.299
I didn't know you were in a bad mood
after the interview.

00:11:15.425 --> 00:11:16.289
And...

00:11:16.618 --> 00:11:18.678
I kept bringing up your ex...

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:20.971
and called you selfish.

00:11:21.472 --> 00:11:23.975
It's all my fault.

00:11:24.058 --> 00:11:25.601
- Please forgive me.
- Min-gi!

00:11:26.452 --> 00:11:28.563
That's not why I'm doing this.

00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:29.814
Stand up.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.234
Then, what's bothering you?

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:38.806
Don't go! Seol-ha, please!

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:40.725
It's just

00:11:40.924 --> 00:11:42.535
that I'm too frustrated!

00:11:42.894 --> 00:11:43.828
I...

00:11:43.978 --> 00:11:47.415
don't even know what I did wrong.

00:11:47.498 --> 00:11:50.793
Put yourself in my shoes
and imagine how frustrated I am.

00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:53.588
So, forgive me just this once.

00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:55.465
I won't let it happen again.

00:11:59.802 --> 00:12:01.287
I get it, so stand up.

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:02.471
No.

00:12:02.664 --> 00:12:05.584
- Stand up.
- I'm not getting up until you forgive me!

00:12:05.667 --> 00:12:07.018
Just get up!

00:12:07.102 --> 00:12:08.728
I don't want to.

00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:14.400
I don't want to see my boyfriend
like this.

00:12:15.318 --> 00:12:16.361
Stand up.

00:12:23.378 --> 00:12:24.604
Seol-ha.

00:12:36.114 --> 00:12:37.424
I'm sorry.

00:12:37.966 --> 00:12:39.551
It's all my fault, Seol-ha.

00:12:40.957 --> 00:12:43.550
I'm sorry too, Min-gi.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.476
But you do know...

00:12:49.027 --> 00:12:52.564
that you were also in the wrong, right?

00:12:56.067 --> 00:12:58.861
Yes, it's my fault too.

00:13:02.524 --> 00:13:04.876
CRINGY ROMANCE

00:13:04.959 --> 00:13:06.619
All right. It's okay.

00:13:10.164 --> 00:13:11.332
That will be 50 cents.

00:13:17.338 --> 00:13:18.339
Have a good day.

00:13:36.407 --> 00:13:37.983
That will be 6.80 dollars.

00:13:41.904 --> 00:13:43.614
Look. It's cute, right?

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.582
- Thank you.
- Have a good day.

00:13:54.651 --> 00:13:56.086
Here. I got you one too.

00:14:00.114 --> 00:14:01.257
Make sure to put this on.

00:14:04.385 --> 00:14:05.553
I'll get going. Work hard.

00:14:34.649 --> 00:14:36.885
And stop crying because of Gyu-cheol!

00:14:38.127 --> 00:14:39.670
When you cry because of him,

00:14:40.822 --> 00:14:42.590
it breaks my heart.

00:15:11.019 --> 00:15:12.037
Ju-yeon.

00:15:12.286 --> 00:15:14.872
The food is ready.
Tell Jun-seok to come downstairs.

00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:16.416
Okay.

00:15:24.157 --> 00:15:25.550
Thank you for the food.

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:33.975
You two...

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:37.728
thought I wouldn't find out, huh?

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.692
I've been waiting all this time

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:45.028
for you two to tell me the truth.

00:15:48.222 --> 00:15:49.240
What?

00:15:50.158 --> 00:15:51.868
You're really not going to tell me?

00:15:54.395 --> 00:15:55.271
What do you mean?

00:15:55.354 --> 00:15:57.998
About what happened with you two
while I was gone!

00:16:06.975 --> 00:16:08.176
So Ju-yeon.

00:16:10.228 --> 00:16:11.596
What?

00:16:11.679 --> 00:16:13.581
I'm a cop, kid.

00:16:13.664 --> 00:16:16.517
I see right through people
just from their eyes.

00:16:18.853 --> 00:16:19.896
You...

00:16:23.841 --> 00:16:24.925
and Jun-seok.

00:16:26.736 --> 00:16:27.862
You know?

00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:30.073
You know?

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.202
You two fought, didn't you?
And you hit him, didn't you?

00:16:38.172 --> 00:16:39.999
Gosh. Jun-seok.

00:16:40.082 --> 00:16:42.835
It's all good. You can tell me the truth.

00:16:42.918 --> 00:16:44.918
- No, that's not true.
- Ju-yeon!

00:16:45.001 --> 00:16:46.263
You should be glad
it was a simple assault.

00:16:46.346 --> 00:16:49.133
If there had been facial injuries,
it would have been an aggravated assault!

00:16:50.059 --> 00:16:52.219
Jun-seok, I apologize on her behalf.

00:16:52.302 --> 00:16:55.806
She takes after me,
so she has fists of iron.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.892
That's a lethal weapon right there.

00:16:58.084 --> 00:17:00.348
Don't use your lethal weapon to eat food!

00:17:00.432 --> 00:17:01.813
Sir, that never happened.

00:17:01.896 --> 00:17:04.482
I just can't leave the house.

00:17:04.565 --> 00:17:06.901
Don't go anywhere. I'm not done yet.

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:09.487
Yes.

00:17:10.279 --> 00:17:11.405
You found him?

00:17:11.989 --> 00:17:14.867
See? I told you to look there first.

00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:18.830
Of course. I'll be there soon. Wait there.

00:17:19.288 --> 00:17:21.040
You seriously...

00:17:22.733 --> 00:17:23.792
Goodbye.

00:17:24.093 --> 00:17:26.086
No, eat up.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:00.955
These stir-fried potatoes are really good.

00:18:01.898 --> 00:18:02.916
Those are seasoned radish strips.

00:18:04.375 --> 00:18:05.334
Right.

00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:08.462
I knew potatoes couldn't be this crunchy.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:12.967
- Did he make these himself?
- They're store-bought.

00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:15.762
Right?

00:18:16.004 --> 00:18:19.223
He just knows which products to buy.

00:18:40.978 --> 00:18:41.954
What?

00:18:45.249 --> 00:18:46.333
Okay.

00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:51.677
Who is it?

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:53.424
Gyu-cheol?

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:55.758
- Yes.
- What did he say?

00:18:57.136 --> 00:18:59.305
He wants me to come outside.
He's in front of my house.

00:19:01.762 --> 00:19:03.762
- I'll come with you.
- Don't bother.

00:19:04.377 --> 00:19:05.561
This is between me and Gyu-cheol.

00:19:07.872 --> 00:19:11.484
There's ointment and some bandages
in the bottom drawer of my desk.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:13.653
Use those.

00:19:13.844 --> 00:19:14.695
Okay.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.051
All done?

00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:20.469
I'm going back in.

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:24.223
Ju-yeon.

00:20:27.518 --> 00:20:28.728
I'm truly...

00:20:30.671 --> 00:20:32.064
I'm truly sorry.

00:20:34.133 --> 00:20:35.609
I've got nothing to say for myself.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:37.736
I'm completely at fault.

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:40.781
I'm...

00:20:42.016 --> 00:20:43.034
fully aware...

00:20:44.076 --> 00:20:46.161
that I have no place...

00:20:46.854 --> 00:20:49.456
and no shame to be saying this to you.

00:20:57.114 --> 00:20:58.215
But Ju-yeon...

00:21:06.165 --> 00:21:07.183
What?

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.730
Are we still keeping...

00:21:14.173 --> 00:21:15.566
the couple's cellular plan?

00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:22.406
Right.

00:21:23.908 --> 00:21:25.560
- Let's go and cancel it.
- No.

00:21:25.643 --> 00:21:27.203
I don't want to cancel it.

00:21:28.963 --> 00:21:29.872
Can you

00:21:30.314 --> 00:21:32.041
sell me your number?

00:21:35.361 --> 00:21:36.337
What?

00:21:38.614 --> 00:21:40.341
It'd be a waste, you know.

00:21:40.424 --> 00:21:41.467
It's not like...

00:21:42.635 --> 00:21:44.804
you and I will call each other
from here on out.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.478
Don't tell me...

00:21:54.438 --> 00:21:57.441
you're thinking of buying my number
and giving it to your new girlfriend.

00:21:59.427 --> 00:22:01.427
Tell me you're not actually thinking
something that disgusting.

00:22:04.014 --> 00:22:05.157
"Disgusting?"

00:22:06.158 --> 00:22:08.369
- You don't have to be so blunt.
- Hey.

00:22:09.828 --> 00:22:11.163
- How could you--
- All right.

00:22:11.372 --> 00:22:12.373
I understand.

00:22:13.374 --> 00:22:14.417
If you don't want to,

00:22:15.417 --> 00:22:17.878
let's sell both our numbers
to someone else.

00:22:19.505 --> 00:22:20.890
At an online flea market,

00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:24.143
we could make up to 320 dollars.

00:22:26.328 --> 00:22:27.387
Or...

00:22:28.305 --> 00:22:29.681
you could just...

00:22:30.875 --> 00:22:32.810
buy my number.

00:22:33.811 --> 00:22:36.313
Then, I can just change my number.

00:22:41.861 --> 00:22:43.029
Ju-yeon?

00:22:44.137 --> 00:22:47.066
JUN-SEOK AND JU-YEON
JU-YEON, LET'S GET MARRIED WHEN WE GROW UP

00:22:51.495 --> 00:22:52.746
You!

00:22:54.523 --> 00:22:55.707
Shoot.

00:22:56.542 --> 00:22:58.210
Ju-yeon may seem cold and tough

00:22:58.293 --> 00:22:59.879
at first glance,

00:23:02.281 --> 00:23:03.257
but she's actually

00:23:04.408 --> 00:23:05.759
even colder

00:23:06.468 --> 00:23:08.178
- and even tougher.
- Come outside, jerk.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:09.496
- I said, "Come out!"
- Stop!

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:10.681
What's going on?

00:23:10.764 --> 00:23:12.099
Your car will be wrecked at this rate.

00:23:12.467 --> 00:23:13.318
Is that what you want?

00:23:13.934 --> 00:23:15.060
Come outside!

00:23:17.363 --> 00:23:18.756
Are you out of your mind?

00:23:19.407 --> 00:23:20.314
Don't.

00:23:21.283 --> 00:23:22.484
You're dead meat now.

00:23:22.968 --> 00:23:24.027
She's crazy.

00:23:24.995 --> 00:23:26.238
She's got a brick!

00:23:26.321 --> 00:23:27.992
- Watch out!
- Ju-yeon, please.

00:23:28.075 --> 00:23:29.075
Ju-yeon.

00:23:29.775 --> 00:23:31.368
- Stop, Ju-yeon!
- Get off me.

00:23:32.061 --> 00:23:34.163
- Let me go!
- Don't do this.

00:23:34.396 --> 00:23:35.455
Let go.

00:23:36.455 --> 00:23:37.700
- I'll kill him!
- Ju-yeon...

00:23:37.783 --> 00:23:39.001
Just get out of here!

00:23:39.084 --> 00:23:40.753
- You!
- She's about to kill you!

00:23:40.836 --> 00:23:42.722
- Just go!
- You!

00:23:42.805 --> 00:23:44.390
- Go away!
- Hey!

00:23:44.473 --> 00:23:45.384
Stop!

00:23:45.671 --> 00:23:46.716
Hey!

00:23:53.807 --> 00:23:55.626
Let go of me!

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:59.438
Do you know what he said to me?

00:23:59.755 --> 00:24:00.765
I understand.

00:24:00.848 --> 00:24:02.066
Forget about him.

00:24:02.191 --> 00:24:03.859
Calm down. It's okay.

00:24:05.244 --> 00:24:06.570
It's all right.

00:24:15.946 --> 00:24:17.038
It's fine.

00:24:17.121 --> 00:24:19.121
Bring him to me.

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:38.050
Hey, Kwon!

00:24:44.425 --> 00:24:45.776
I caught you red-handed.

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:47.194
- Take these.
- What brings you here?

00:24:49.071 --> 00:24:50.114
What are these?

00:24:55.953 --> 00:24:57.037
Bring these to Hui-seon.

00:24:57.371 --> 00:24:58.372
What are they?

00:24:58.597 --> 00:25:00.916
I was making your side dishes,
and I made some for her too.

00:25:01.519 --> 00:25:02.626
Why?

00:25:03.961 --> 00:25:05.421
She doesn't eat these.

00:25:05.946 --> 00:25:08.298
- Take them back.
- Put everything in the refrigerator.

00:25:08.574 --> 00:25:11.677
But this is soy sauce marinated crab,
so tell her to put it in the freezer.

00:25:12.027 --> 00:25:13.220
If she wants to eat it for a long time.

00:25:14.438 --> 00:25:15.472
Quit smoking.

00:25:16.265 --> 00:25:17.349
I'm leaving.

00:25:20.085 --> 00:25:20.977
Go back inside.

00:26:26.627 --> 00:26:27.711
Sorry.

00:26:33.675 --> 00:26:36.428
Isn't this Hui-seon's house?

00:26:36.954 --> 00:26:38.806
She went outside for a moment.

00:26:38.914 --> 00:26:39.890
Who are you?

00:26:40.457 --> 00:26:42.601
I'm her friend.

00:26:46.814 --> 00:26:48.357
Come in. I'm her mom.

00:26:50.175 --> 00:26:51.651
You can wait inside.

00:26:53.262 --> 00:26:54.321
Hey, it's me.

00:26:55.531 --> 00:26:57.867
So, how are we going to do this?

00:27:00.202 --> 00:27:01.286
Who?

00:27:04.898 --> 00:27:06.291
Mr. Park from the optical store?

00:27:06.984 --> 00:27:08.127
Seriously?

00:27:11.739 --> 00:27:13.090
He also wants in?

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:16.343
I thought he lost all his money last time.

00:27:18.704 --> 00:27:19.805
He's lost his mind.

00:27:20.706 --> 00:27:22.307
And his wife won't stop him?

00:27:24.726 --> 00:27:25.936
Is that right?

00:27:29.256 --> 00:27:30.899
This is getting bigger than I thought.

00:27:32.384 --> 00:27:34.319
Oh, she's here. I'll call you back.

00:27:37.781 --> 00:27:38.865
You're back.

00:27:44.104 --> 00:27:45.247
Wait.

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:48.690
Don't tell me you're going back there.

00:27:49.359 --> 00:27:51.961
What are you talking about? I'm not.

00:27:53.672 --> 00:27:55.489
- You're just going to leave?
- I'm late.

00:27:56.366 --> 00:27:59.386
- But we were going to eat together.
- Sorry. Let's do it next time.

00:28:08.395 --> 00:28:09.354
Hey.

00:28:14.927 --> 00:28:15.861
Right.

00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:18.029
Here. Take these.

00:28:19.389 --> 00:28:21.741
My mom wanted me to bring them to you.

00:28:30.584 --> 00:28:31.752
Your mom?

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.158
She also said

00:29:02.516 --> 00:29:04.618
to keep the soy sauce marinated crab
in the freezer.

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:08.830
I'll do it.

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.333
I'll leave now.

00:29:51.465 --> 00:29:52.708
Can't you stay?

00:30:30.604 --> 00:30:34.108
Did you know he ate with his mouth open
and made so much noise?

00:30:35.651 --> 00:30:37.211
It was so gross.

00:30:39.321 --> 00:30:40.422
Also,

00:30:40.922 --> 00:30:43.216
he liked kimchi stew,

00:30:43.508 --> 00:30:46.553
but he wouldn't eat the kimchi
in a kimchi stew.

00:30:46.895 --> 00:30:47.804
Gosh.

00:30:49.248 --> 00:30:50.432
But he ate...

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.853
the kimchi in stir-fried kimchi.

00:30:55.312 --> 00:30:56.547
He's insane, right?

00:30:57.506 --> 00:31:00.359
How are you going to get over him?
You're thinking about every little detail.

00:31:04.429 --> 00:31:05.488
I know.

00:31:07.366 --> 00:31:08.701
This is driving me crazy.

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:13.080
People say

00:31:14.398 --> 00:31:15.624
that it feels like

00:31:15.999 --> 00:31:19.002
there's a huge hole in the chest
when you break up, right?

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.531
I used to hate that because it sounded

00:31:22.614 --> 00:31:24.132
so cliché and overused.

00:31:25.801 --> 00:31:26.885
But you know what?

00:31:29.513 --> 00:31:31.682
There's really no better way
to describe it.

00:31:33.141 --> 00:31:34.142
You know,

00:31:34.851 --> 00:31:36.269
it feels...

00:31:38.772 --> 00:31:41.566
so empty in the chest
that it puts you in a filthy mood.

00:31:47.264 --> 00:31:48.448
Do you regret dating him?

00:31:53.412 --> 00:31:54.788
Why would I regret it?

00:31:55.707 --> 00:31:57.415
I gave him all my love
without any regrets.

00:32:00.836 --> 00:32:02.713
I did my very best.

00:32:03.797 --> 00:32:04.840
That's all that matters.

00:32:11.246 --> 00:32:13.682
What does it actually mean
to love someone?

00:32:16.601 --> 00:32:18.520
After I broke up with Gyu-cheol,

00:32:20.939 --> 00:32:23.775
do you know the first thing
that came to my mind?

00:32:24.192 --> 00:32:25.151
What was it?

00:32:26.345 --> 00:32:27.821
Taking the express bus

00:32:28.572 --> 00:32:30.032
to Daejeon

00:32:30.824 --> 00:32:33.994
for four hours every single day,
just to be with him for a little while.

00:32:37.497 --> 00:32:38.540
Yes,

00:32:39.124 --> 00:32:41.124
it sounds pretty crazy now.

00:32:41.835 --> 00:32:42.794
But you know what?

00:32:44.104 --> 00:32:45.964
Back then, none of it felt difficult.

00:32:48.091 --> 00:32:49.342
That's when I realized,

00:32:51.178 --> 00:32:52.179
"So,"

00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:55.641
"this is who I become"

00:32:57.225 --> 00:32:58.685
"when I'm in love."

00:33:01.296 --> 00:33:04.524
"It makes me want to act
without thinking twice."

00:33:09.279 --> 00:33:12.616
Wanting to act for someone
without thinking twice.

00:33:14.101 --> 00:33:15.936
That means you're in love with them.

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:31.593
Hello?

00:33:32.719 --> 00:33:33.803
What do you think I'm doing?

00:33:34.204 --> 00:33:35.347
I'm drinking.

00:33:37.891 --> 00:33:38.767
What?

00:33:39.167 --> 00:33:40.310
A blind date?

00:33:41.128 --> 00:33:42.271
Who?

00:33:43.813 --> 00:33:46.315
That older guy who's back on campus
that you mentioned last time?

00:33:47.634 --> 00:33:49.861
Are you for real?

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:54.282
No way!

00:33:55.992 --> 00:33:56.993
Sure.

00:34:00.038 --> 00:34:01.289
All right.

00:34:02.749 --> 00:34:04.334
Tomorrow sounds good to me.

00:34:05.544 --> 00:34:07.171
Bye.

00:34:18.707 --> 00:34:20.017
Are you going on a blind date?

00:34:20.417 --> 00:34:21.460
Yes.

00:34:22.227 --> 00:34:24.604
Don't you think it's too soon
for a blind date?

00:34:25.605 --> 00:34:26.606
So what?

00:34:27.007 --> 00:34:28.608
I don't even have a boyfriend anymore.

00:34:28.733 --> 00:34:30.733
Do you have to have a boyfriend?

00:34:31.319 --> 00:34:33.905
- Then, who should I hang out with?
- Me. You can hang out...

00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:39.703
with me.

00:34:44.733 --> 00:34:46.626
I don't mean hanging out as friends.

00:34:59.039 --> 00:35:00.098
Raise your glass.

00:35:00.248 --> 00:35:01.516
Okay.

00:36:04.454 --> 00:36:05.455
You feeling all right?

00:36:06.873 --> 00:36:08.249
So-so.

00:36:12.837 --> 00:36:14.789
HANGOVER CURE

00:36:17.425 --> 00:36:18.551
Drink this.

00:36:19.219 --> 00:36:20.303
Thanks.

00:36:22.847 --> 00:36:23.931
That tastes bad.

00:36:26.267 --> 00:36:29.353
Right. I thought you had a blind date
today. Shouldn't you be getting ready?

00:36:31.923 --> 00:36:32.982
Oh, that.

00:36:34.192 --> 00:36:35.402
I told her I wouldn't take it.

00:36:36.521 --> 00:36:37.529
Why not?

00:36:39.697 --> 00:36:40.698
No reason.

00:36:41.699 --> 00:36:42.867
No reason?

00:37:18.939 --> 00:37:19.939
Ju-yeon.

00:37:21.322 --> 00:37:22.698
Are you free tomorrow?

00:37:27.036 --> 00:37:28.955
How about a movie?

00:37:32.776 --> 00:37:33.835
Sounds good.

00:37:35.887 --> 00:37:37.171
In the afternoon?

00:37:37.364 --> 00:37:39.216
- Let's see a movie in the afternoon.
- Okay.

00:37:39.841 --> 00:37:40.925
Okay.

00:37:58.635 --> 00:37:59.986
Here.

00:38:01.554 --> 00:38:03.614
So, what are you doing on your birthday?

00:38:04.015 --> 00:38:07.201
We're just going to have dinner
with my friends.

00:38:07.535 --> 00:38:08.786
Your friends?

00:38:09.496 --> 00:38:12.290
It's their first time
meeting Min-gi, right?

00:38:12.582 --> 00:38:14.250
- It is.
- I see.

00:38:14.333 --> 00:38:16.333
I bet they'll be shocked.

00:38:17.754 --> 00:38:20.673
By the way,
what has Min-gi been up to lately?

00:38:20.773 --> 00:38:21.966
He's not even coming to the café.

00:38:22.801 --> 00:38:24.469
I don't know. He says he's busy.

00:38:24.869 --> 00:38:25.845
Busy with what?

00:38:26.513 --> 00:38:27.556
I have no idea.

00:38:27.806 --> 00:38:28.765
He says it's a secret.

00:38:29.474 --> 00:38:30.433
A secret?

00:38:47.183 --> 00:38:49.702
Jun-seok, you seem cheerful.
What's the good news?

00:38:50.954 --> 00:38:52.080
Nothing.

00:38:53.248 --> 00:38:54.124
Here.

00:38:54.311 --> 00:38:55.833
Okay. Thanks.

00:38:56.985 --> 00:38:58.336
All right.

00:38:59.487 --> 00:39:01.464
"They say plastic"

00:39:02.457 --> 00:39:04.184
"takes 500 years"

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:07.429
"to break down."

00:39:09.122 --> 00:39:13.059
"That's where I"

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:16.896
"stored"

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:20.274
"my"

00:39:20.759 --> 00:39:21.777
"love."

00:39:22.302 --> 00:39:23.194
Min-gi, I found it.

00:39:23.511 --> 00:39:24.612
Really?

00:39:24.846 --> 00:39:26.030
Hang on.

00:39:32.453 --> 00:39:33.537
Man.

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:35.540
There are so many things to write.

00:39:35.623 --> 00:39:37.623
DO YOU WANT A LOVE
LIKE THE ONES IN BOOKS OR MOVIES?

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:43.339
Min-gi.

00:39:43.506 --> 00:39:44.716
Hey, Gi-hyeok.

00:39:44.882 --> 00:39:47.301
- Is this the one?
- Yes, that's the basket I wanted.

00:39:47.384 --> 00:39:48.719
Thanks for bringing it.

00:39:49.012 --> 00:39:49.971
Man.

00:39:50.513 --> 00:39:52.557
- I'm out of here.
- Where are you going?

00:39:52.916 --> 00:39:53.892
I got stuff to do.

00:39:54.309 --> 00:39:55.352
What stuff?

00:39:58.730 --> 00:39:59.606
Hey,

00:39:59.923 --> 00:40:00.941
what's wrong with him?

00:40:02.025 --> 00:40:03.652
I guess he's tired.

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.845
How come he's tired every day?

00:40:10.683 --> 00:40:12.683
What's this, by the way?

00:40:12.766 --> 00:40:14.870
How many are there?

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:17.457
- Gosh.
- Hey!

00:40:18.666 --> 00:40:20.293
It's 1,004 paper cranes.

00:40:20.401 --> 00:40:22.545
It took me a whole month to fold these.

00:40:22.879 --> 00:40:24.589
You're so devoted.

00:40:25.214 --> 00:40:26.173
Hey.

00:40:27.717 --> 00:40:28.618
Ta-da.

00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:31.178
What is it?

00:40:32.889 --> 00:40:33.848
A blood donation certificate?

00:40:34.365 --> 00:40:36.365
- What's this for?
- You don't get it?

00:40:37.252 --> 00:40:40.605
It means, "I offer a love
worth my very life to her."

00:40:41.589 --> 00:40:43.024
It does mean something.

00:40:43.341 --> 00:40:45.985
- This is the trend nowadays.
- Nonsense.

00:40:46.736 --> 00:40:48.513
So, this is the famous teddy bear.

00:40:48.596 --> 00:40:50.823
- Hey!
- Hi, Seol-ha.

00:40:51.366 --> 00:40:52.576
This is Min-gi.

00:40:53.159 --> 00:40:55.620
Happy birthday today.

00:40:56.396 --> 00:40:58.748
Promise me we'll be in love

00:40:59.107 --> 00:41:00.125
forever.

00:41:01.167 --> 00:41:02.043
I love you,

00:41:02.543 --> 00:41:03.482
Seol-ha.

00:41:03.711 --> 00:41:04.624
Crap.

00:41:04.708 --> 00:41:05.913
- Don't!
- Gross!

00:41:05.997 --> 00:41:07.448
- Get this away from me.
- Come on!

00:41:07.531 --> 00:41:10.593
- Throw it out.
- Come on, guys.

00:41:10.927 --> 00:41:12.178
Are you serious?

00:42:18.937 --> 00:42:20.872
- You put your hair up.
- No, I didn't.

00:42:23.483 --> 00:42:24.417
Did you

00:42:25.418 --> 00:42:26.461
put on makeup?

00:42:27.712 --> 00:42:28.796
No, I didn't.

00:42:29.172 --> 00:42:30.965
I only put on sunscreen.

00:42:33.426 --> 00:42:35.261
- Should we go?
- What? Yes.

00:42:57.283 --> 00:42:58.284
Thanks.

00:42:58.451 --> 00:43:00.451
So, what's your Chinese zodiac sign,
Min-gi?

00:43:00.578 --> 00:43:02.371
I was born in the Year of the Rooster.

00:43:02.772 --> 00:43:04.415
I was also born
in the Year of the Rooster.

00:43:04.624 --> 00:43:06.624
Does that mean
you two share the same zodiac sign?

00:43:07.235 --> 00:43:09.254
I wish I was 20 years old.

00:43:10.321 --> 00:43:11.422
Baby,

00:43:11.505 --> 00:43:13.591
I thought you looked young,

00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:15.301
but I realized that you didn't.

00:43:15.384 --> 00:43:16.928
Of course, my age is--

00:43:18.766 --> 00:43:20.806
Byeong-ho, switch seats with me.

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:22.890
- Not a chance.
- What?

00:43:24.769 --> 00:43:25.837
Give me a second.

00:43:27.922 --> 00:43:28.814
How about now?

00:43:29.007 --> 00:43:30.108
No.

00:43:30.425 --> 00:43:31.443
Don't do that.

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:34.070
He's so obedient.

00:43:38.933 --> 00:43:39.867
It's sweet.

00:43:40.129 --> 00:43:41.786
It is. Do you want to try mine?

00:43:45.189 --> 00:43:46.123
- It's good, right?
- Want a bite?

00:43:48.793 --> 00:43:49.672
Hey!

00:43:50.253 --> 00:43:51.463
You can't eat that much.

00:43:52.338 --> 00:43:53.631
My ice cream is better.

00:43:54.554 --> 00:43:55.633
That's a cute shop.

00:43:59.737 --> 00:44:00.771
Rock, paper, scissors.

00:44:00.855 --> 00:44:01.898
Rock, paper, scissors.

00:44:05.168 --> 00:44:07.937
What's going on with KOSDAQ these days?

00:44:08.104 --> 00:44:09.439
It's about to go below 1,000.

00:44:10.298 --> 00:44:13.218
It's not just 1,000.
They say it might go below 500.

00:44:13.301 --> 00:44:14.444
- What?
- Did you say 500?

00:44:14.969 --> 00:44:17.113
Maybe we'll be in another IMF Crisis.

00:44:17.446 --> 00:44:19.114
What is wrong with the world?

00:44:19.448 --> 00:44:21.448
It's probably
due to the US interest rate hike.

00:44:21.826 --> 00:44:22.998
It's not that.

00:44:23.081 --> 00:44:25.288
All the IT startups these days are
in a bubble.

00:44:25.663 --> 00:44:29.500
The NASDAQ is in correction mode
because of all the dot-com-like companies.

00:44:30.168 --> 00:44:31.778
What are you going to do now?

00:44:31.861 --> 00:44:32.921
You should sell your stocks now.

00:44:33.462 --> 00:44:34.672
It's too late for that.

00:44:37.033 --> 00:44:38.760
These poor guys.

00:44:39.427 --> 00:44:40.386
Let's drink.

00:44:41.229 --> 00:44:42.263
Cheers.

00:44:44.017 --> 00:44:46.434
Fellow "bagholders," raise your glass.

00:44:46.517 --> 00:44:47.685
Yes.

00:44:50.046 --> 00:44:51.814
Wait. Were you bitten by it too?

00:44:53.132 --> 00:44:54.634
I was bitten hard.

00:44:54.717 --> 00:44:56.986
- Oh, man.
- This guy.

00:44:57.095 --> 00:44:58.955
I can't believe you were bitten too.
It's good to have you.

00:45:01.008 --> 00:45:02.517
I was also...

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:03.804
bitten.

00:45:04.994 --> 00:45:07.079
Do you also trade stocks?

00:45:07.238 --> 00:45:09.540
- Sorry?
- Do you have stocks too?

00:45:09.832 --> 00:45:10.665
Stocks?

00:45:10.749 --> 00:45:11.876
What's that?

00:45:13.444 --> 00:45:14.670
No, I don't.

00:45:18.116 --> 00:45:19.634
- Right, Seol-ha. The cake.
- Yes?

00:45:19.717 --> 00:45:20.576
Oh, right.

00:45:20.659 --> 00:45:21.927
- Let's get the cake.
- Yes.

00:45:22.011 --> 00:45:24.138
- I forgot why we gathered.
- It's time for candles.

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:28.559
Blow them out!

00:45:32.537 --> 00:45:34.315
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

00:45:34.398 --> 00:45:35.524
Happy birthday, Seol-ha.

00:45:35.607 --> 00:45:37.818
- Thanks, Min-gi.
- Can you give me the bag next to you?

00:45:39.954 --> 00:45:42.073
- Here you go.
- Presents!

00:45:42.265 --> 00:45:43.658
- Thank you so much.
- Happy birthday.

00:45:43.741 --> 00:45:44.826
Thanks.

00:45:44.909 --> 00:45:46.244
What's this one?

00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:57.796
174 DOLLARS

00:45:57.879 --> 00:46:00.007
- It's so pretty!
- Do you like it?

00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:01.508
This brand had a lot of pretty products.

00:46:01.592 --> 00:46:02.927
One hundred...

00:46:04.178 --> 00:46:05.179
That's good.

00:46:05.763 --> 00:46:06.847
I'll try it on.

00:46:09.083 --> 00:46:10.101
How do I look?

00:46:10.293 --> 00:46:11.978
It's perfect for you.

00:46:12.336 --> 00:46:13.437
Really?

00:46:13.546 --> 00:46:15.356
Min-gi, what do you think?
It's cute, isn't it?

00:46:15.439 --> 00:46:16.774
Yes, it's cute.

00:46:17.216 --> 00:46:18.943
Thanks. I'll wear it all the time.

00:46:19.185 --> 00:46:20.987
- Open our presents too.
- Okay.

00:46:26.845 --> 00:46:27.953
Oh, my gosh.

00:46:28.286 --> 00:46:29.704
You didn't have to get me
such an expensive one.

00:46:29.896 --> 00:46:31.898
I heard it was hard to get one of these.

00:46:31.981 --> 00:46:32.899
428 DOLLARS

00:46:32.982 --> 00:46:34.834
My boyfriend had a connection
from that store.

00:46:34.959 --> 00:46:36.127
It was tough to get one.

00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:38.129
Luckily, they had one left.

00:46:39.005 --> 00:46:41.132
Thank you so much. I love it.

00:46:49.732 --> 00:46:51.434
- Thanks.
- Do you like it?

00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.060
I know you always use this one.

00:46:53.361 --> 00:46:54.687
- Thank you so much.
- What's that?

00:46:55.338 --> 00:46:57.338
- Hey!
- Oh, my gosh!

00:46:58.190 --> 00:46:59.650
- That's incredible.
- How amazing.

00:46:59.733 --> 00:47:00.943
- That's awesome.
- Oh, my!

00:47:02.178 --> 00:47:03.780
What is that? A gift basket?

00:47:03.863 --> 00:47:06.240
It's been so long
since I last saw one of these!

00:47:06.999 --> 00:47:08.334
Is this from you, Min-gi? Let me open it.

00:47:08.417 --> 00:47:09.660
No, you can open it at home.

00:47:09.852 --> 00:47:11.370
I want to see it now.

00:47:11.712 --> 00:47:12.913
No, open it at home.

00:47:14.915 --> 00:47:15.791
Adorable!

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:17.110
Let us see it too.

00:47:17.193 --> 00:47:18.598
- Is this a teddy bear?
- That's so cute.

00:47:18.682 --> 00:47:20.463
- My gosh.
- It's adorable.

00:47:20.821 --> 00:47:22.047
Seol-ha, show us.

00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:24.450
Look at these!
How many paper cranes are these?

00:47:24.742 --> 00:47:26.927
- A hundred?
- More like five hundred.

00:47:27.954 --> 00:47:30.765
Wait. Isn't this a love note?

00:47:30.957 --> 00:47:32.667
- A what?
- What's that?

00:47:33.517 --> 00:47:34.919
Is this what you get
when you have a younger boyfriend?

00:47:35.002 --> 00:47:37.187
No, I'm going to read it alone at home.

00:47:38.464 --> 00:47:39.857
I told you to read it at home.

00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:41.940
- Oh, my gosh.
- That's so cute!

00:47:42.023 --> 00:47:43.402
We want to see it too.

00:47:45.163 --> 00:47:46.823
I told you to read it at home!

00:47:48.099 --> 00:47:49.117
What?

00:47:53.579 --> 00:47:54.580
Min-gi!

00:47:54.855 --> 00:47:55.873
But...

00:47:56.332 --> 00:47:57.792
Give me the paper cranes.

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:00.378
These are

00:48:00.736 --> 00:48:02.421
one thousand paper cranes.

00:48:03.531 --> 00:48:04.882
Have you ever tried folding 1,000 cranes?

00:48:05.516 --> 00:48:06.926
- What...
- What's the matter with him?

00:48:08.219 --> 00:48:09.554
Sorry. I have to go.

00:48:09.637 --> 00:48:10.888
- What?
- Sorry.

00:48:11.038 --> 00:48:12.681
Don't forget these.

00:48:13.474 --> 00:48:15.351
- Min-gi!
- But you need to pay!

00:48:16.043 --> 00:48:17.978
- Min-gi!
- Come on. Read the room.

00:48:20.172 --> 00:48:21.231
Min-gi.

00:48:23.017 --> 00:48:24.151
Min-gi!

00:48:27.613 --> 00:48:29.406
What's wrong? Wait.

00:48:30.558 --> 00:48:32.143
- What's wrong with you?
- Get off me!

00:48:32.227 --> 00:48:34.328
Why? What's the problem?

00:48:36.872 --> 00:48:38.290
Why are you doing this?

00:48:39.875 --> 00:48:40.876
Give it back.

00:48:41.110 --> 00:48:42.378
What's wrong?

00:48:43.629 --> 00:48:46.131
I'll get you a proper birthday gift.
Give it back to me.

00:48:49.301 --> 00:48:51.887
Your birthday gift is my favorite.

00:48:54.431 --> 00:48:55.682
Is that why you laughed at it so hard?

00:48:55.875 --> 00:48:57.476
What are you talking about now?

00:48:57.559 --> 00:48:59.020
Everyone laughed at my gift.

00:48:59.103 --> 00:49:00.605
Who laughed at it?

00:49:00.688 --> 00:49:03.858
Your friends, your friends' boyfriends,
and you. Everyone did!

00:49:03.941 --> 00:49:05.718
What makes you think
we were laughing at it?

00:49:05.802 --> 00:49:08.196
We were just laughing, Min-gi.

00:49:09.889 --> 00:49:10.781
You--

00:49:13.642 --> 00:49:15.661
You never laughed when you saw
all those other expensive gifts!

00:49:15.745 --> 00:49:18.038
You laughed only when you got mine!

00:49:24.278 --> 00:49:25.921
Let's not do this, Min-gi.

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:27.339
Not here.

00:49:27.422 --> 00:49:29.422
Why do you keep telling me
not to do things?

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:31.927
What else am I supposed to do?

00:49:33.287 --> 00:49:34.580
Give it to me. I'll buy you a new gift.

00:49:34.663 --> 00:49:36.582
- No!
- I'll get you

00:49:36.665 --> 00:49:38.135
- I said it was fine!
- a proper gift!

00:49:38.218 --> 00:49:39.352
Min-gi!

00:49:45.341 --> 00:49:46.525
You're seriously...

00:49:56.227 --> 00:49:57.453
You're so...

00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:54.069
- Hey.
- Yes?

00:51:54.152 --> 00:51:56.864
Weren't the people at the next table
from our middle school too?

00:51:57.197 --> 00:51:59.783
Right? Grade 2 Class 4.

00:52:00.809 --> 00:52:02.809
- You're right.
- I Love School is bringing

00:52:02.892 --> 00:52:04.229
everyone together back.

00:52:04.312 --> 00:52:05.414
- I know, right?
- Guys.

00:52:05.748 --> 00:52:06.791
Should we go to that club?

00:52:07.166 --> 00:52:09.877
- I love clubs! Let's go.
- Sure. I've never been to one before.

00:52:10.444 --> 00:52:12.296
Hold on. Come to think of it,

00:52:12.379 --> 00:52:14.615
I don't think a club is a good idea.
Let's drink another round.

00:52:14.698 --> 00:52:17.509
- Why?
- Let's just go. Next round is on me.

00:52:17.592 --> 00:52:19.970
- But there are so many people!
- I'll buy the next round.

00:52:20.054 --> 00:52:21.597
- We won't be drinking plain soju.
- What would we do by ourselves?

00:52:21.681 --> 00:52:23.999
- We're getting expensive drinks.
- Go ahead.

00:52:24.083 --> 00:52:25.267
- Where should we go, though?
- Come on.

00:52:25.351 --> 00:52:26.435
What's wrong with you?

00:52:28.187 --> 00:52:29.797
Let's go.

00:52:29.881 --> 00:52:32.108
- What do you guys want?
- Chinese food?

00:52:32.191 --> 00:52:33.693
Yes, let's get Chinese.

00:52:35.903 --> 00:52:36.904
Jun-seok.

00:52:37.304 --> 00:52:39.906
Wasn't the ocean from the movie earlier
so beautiful?

00:52:40.324 --> 00:52:42.451
It was so pretty.

00:52:42.585 --> 00:52:43.911
And Jun Ji-hyun was prettier.

00:52:43.994 --> 00:52:45.454
I agree.

00:52:46.246 --> 00:52:47.247
You cried, didn't you?

00:52:47.706 --> 00:52:50.918
What are you talking about?
Don't be ridiculous.

00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:53.087
I never cry.

00:52:55.297 --> 00:52:58.050
A day like this calls
for a plate of sashimi

00:52:58.409 --> 00:52:59.719
and soju with beer by the ocean.

00:53:01.053 --> 00:53:02.554
That would have been fantastic.

00:53:02.637 --> 00:53:03.764
- Right?
- Yes.

00:53:08.435 --> 00:53:09.394
Hey.

00:53:10.546 --> 00:53:12.546
Speaking of which,
how about we go see the ocean?

00:53:12.898 --> 00:53:14.898
The ocean? I'd love that.

00:53:16.051 --> 00:53:17.611
- Are you being serious?
- I'm being serious.

00:53:18.512 --> 00:53:19.488
Wait.

00:53:20.155 --> 00:53:21.281
How about Saturday?

00:53:21.573 --> 00:53:23.366
My dad is going on another business trip
that day.

00:53:23.449 --> 00:53:25.102
Perfect. Let's go this Saturday.

00:53:25.185 --> 00:53:27.287
Okay. If we're going,

00:53:27.487 --> 00:53:28.998
let's go to the ocean
that was in the movie.

00:53:30.299 --> 00:53:31.375
That's a great idea.

00:53:31.942 --> 00:53:33.877
- We're actually doing it?
- We are.

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:35.295
But which ocean is that?

00:53:35.879 --> 00:53:37.297
I don't know. I'll look it up.
We'll go there.

00:53:37.965 --> 00:53:40.509
- I love it! Pinky promise.
- Promise.

00:53:41.285 --> 00:53:43.412
- No take-backs.
- You can't back out now.

00:53:43.495 --> 00:53:44.597
I won't let you.

00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:45.723
This is crazy!

00:53:45.873 --> 00:53:47.099
- Let's clink glasses.
- We're definitely going.

00:53:51.505 --> 00:53:53.484
I can't wait to go.

00:53:54.590 --> 00:53:55.733
You don't know who Tupac is?

00:53:56.108 --> 00:53:56.984
Tupac?

00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:59.528
California love

00:53:59.611 --> 00:54:01.118
Oh, I know.

00:54:01.202 --> 00:54:03.448
- I love that song.
- That's Tupac's song.

00:54:04.283 --> 00:54:06.160
Is it? I didn't know.

00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:07.703
But you said you liked hip-hop.

00:54:08.062 --> 00:54:09.914
But I don't really know the singers.

00:54:10.456 --> 00:54:12.792
Then, what are you into?

00:54:13.108 --> 00:54:13.965
Dance?

00:54:14.326 --> 00:54:16.169
- Yes.
- What kind of dance?

00:54:16.378 --> 00:54:17.754
Locking? Popping?

00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:19.089
B-boying?

00:54:20.632 --> 00:54:21.675
I don't know any.

00:54:22.426 --> 00:54:24.345
You're really particular about that.

00:54:26.955 --> 00:54:29.349
Well, I didn't mean to be particular.

00:54:30.876 --> 00:54:32.311
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

00:54:33.729 --> 00:54:35.189
- Oh, no.
- Gosh.

00:54:35.606 --> 00:54:38.067
Come on. That's filthy.

00:54:40.736 --> 00:54:42.238
You can eat all of it.

00:54:45.641 --> 00:54:46.742
My bad.

00:54:47.826 --> 00:54:48.660
I need to go to the restroom.

00:55:14.713 --> 00:55:16.393
- Just a second.
- What?

00:55:47.745 --> 00:55:50.097
Is there a part-time job that pays fast?

00:55:50.581 --> 00:55:51.807
How much money do you need?

00:55:52.432 --> 00:55:54.517
About 500 dollars.

00:55:54.652 --> 00:55:55.686
What?

00:55:56.103 --> 00:55:57.396
Why do you need that much money?

00:55:58.438 --> 00:56:00.690
Apparently, that's how much
a pair of designer shoes costs.

00:56:01.191 --> 00:56:03.735
Why does a 20-year-old need
designer labels?

00:56:03.818 --> 00:56:05.904
I'm 20 years old, but Seol-ha isn't.

00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:08.073
Whatever.

00:56:08.265 --> 00:56:10.814
I might go insane if I don't do this,

00:56:10.898 --> 00:56:13.078
so just tell me what's a quick-paying job.

00:56:18.917 --> 00:56:19.960
You're here.

00:56:23.155 --> 00:56:24.715
Right, Gi-hyeok. Come here.

00:56:29.244 --> 00:56:30.345
Is this yours?

00:56:32.039 --> 00:56:33.381
I came to work this morning,

00:56:33.465 --> 00:56:35.244
and a girl came
and asked me to give you these.

00:56:58.665 --> 00:57:00.250
What? Hey!

00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:01.626
Where are you going?

00:57:06.757 --> 00:57:09.343
The number you've dialed is not
in service.

00:57:12.246 --> 00:57:15.399
HIDEOUT BAR

00:57:19.562 --> 00:57:22.189
HIDEOUT BAR

00:57:22.823 --> 00:57:23.982
What are you doing here?

00:58:18.186 --> 00:58:19.287
Hui-seon.

00:58:22.316 --> 00:58:23.334
Hui-seon!

00:58:26.003 --> 00:58:26.962
Hui-seon!

00:58:27.921 --> 00:58:29.431
- Excuse me.
- Hui-seon!

00:58:29.514 --> 00:58:30.465
Excuse me!

00:58:32.392 --> 00:58:33.468
She moved out.

00:58:38.223 --> 00:58:40.434
- I'm sorry?
- The girl moved out of that house.

00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:05.334
The number you've dialed is not
in service.

00:59:05.817 --> 00:59:08.253
Please check the number and try again.

00:59:17.204 --> 00:59:19.932
The number you've dialed is not
in service.

00:59:20.207 --> 00:59:22.726
Please check the number and try again.
