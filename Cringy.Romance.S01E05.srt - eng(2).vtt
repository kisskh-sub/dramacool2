- Come outside.
- Don't do it.

00:00:42.053 --> 00:00:43.919
Come outside, bastard.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.297
Come outside. What did you say to me?

00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:49.131
What did you say to me just now?

00:00:49.214 --> 00:00:51.218
You prick. Say that again.

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:54.262
Hey, say that to me again.

00:00:54.513 --> 00:00:55.831
Punk.

00:00:56.707 --> 00:00:58.976
Say it again.

00:00:59.276 --> 00:01:00.949
Little punk. Put your head up.

00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:02.604
You scumbag!

00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:05.440
Get your hands off him!

00:01:09.528 --> 00:01:12.264
Get your freaking hands off him.

00:01:12.456 --> 00:01:14.500
- Come here, you prick.
- Hui-seon!

00:01:14.583 --> 00:01:15.827
Get over here.
- Don't do this.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:16.795
Get over here!

00:01:16.878 --> 00:01:17.897
- Hui-seon.
- Hey!

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.496
- Who's this crazy girl?
- Let me go!

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:23.509
Does he look like a pushover
just because he works here, punk?

00:01:23.592 --> 00:01:25.903
- Gosh.
- Who are you to get involved?

00:01:25.986 --> 00:01:29.339
What? I'm your mama, you lowlife!

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:31.133
Why are you doing this to us?

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.841
Shut your damn mouth

00:01:32.924 --> 00:01:35.329
before I rip your mouth open,
sashimi-style.

00:01:35.412 --> 00:01:37.765
- Get over here, jerk!
- Hui-seon, stop.

00:01:37.848 --> 00:01:40.184
- Don't do this.
- Let me go!

00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:42.519
- I'm going to kill that bastard tonight!
- Gosh.

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:43.853
Come here!

00:01:43.936 --> 00:01:45.730
- Hey!
- Let's get out of here.

00:01:45.813 --> 00:01:47.148
Where do you think you're going?

00:01:47.561 --> 00:01:50.110
- What a lunatic.
- You worthless pieces of shit!

00:02:21.642 --> 00:02:22.726
Thanks.

CRINGY ROMANCE

00:03:23.378 --> 00:03:24.788
About last time...

00:03:25.272 --> 00:03:26.832
Don't say anything.

00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:30.961
You need to watch the wound.

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:42.055
At a moment like this,

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:44.516
you just need to stay still.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.144
You keep staying still,

00:03:50.213 --> 00:03:51.815
and it heals before you know it.

00:04:21.795 --> 00:04:24.723
- It stings.
- Are you disinfecting it?

00:04:36.927 --> 00:04:38.779
Why? You can't come up with anything?

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:42.657
I just don't know what my strengths are.

00:04:43.617 --> 00:04:45.702
Your strengths? You have a lot.

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:49.206
You're pretty, elegant, kind, and cute.

00:04:49.764 --> 00:04:51.958
No, stop joking.

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:54.002
I mean it!

00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:57.506
Strengths?

00:04:58.073 --> 00:05:00.073
Strengths...

00:05:01.343 --> 00:05:02.761
It does sound a little vague.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.596
What weaknesses did you write?

00:05:05.105 --> 00:05:06.173
My weaknesses?

00:05:06.515 --> 00:05:09.460
"I tend to obsess over small details,
which sometimes prevents me"

00:05:09.543 --> 00:05:11.019
"from seeing the bigger picture."

00:05:11.248 --> 00:05:13.438
"So, I often work more slowly than others"

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:16.650
"and occasionally end up working late."
That's what I wrote.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.484
It sounds weird, doesn't it?

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:22.238
It sounds like

00:05:22.823 --> 00:05:24.908
it can also be your strength.

00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:26.785
What do you mean by that?

00:05:27.144 --> 00:05:31.123
Obsessing over small details means
you're detail-oriented.

00:05:31.982 --> 00:05:34.526
Working slowly means you're careful.

00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:38.963
Finishing the job by working late means
you have a strong sense of responsibility.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.510
I guess that makes sense.

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:48.640
So, I think it would be best
to approach it by saying

00:05:49.166 --> 00:05:51.927
that you'll try to amplify your strengths
and improve on your weaknesses.

00:05:53.393 --> 00:05:54.463
Yes.

00:05:54.546 --> 00:05:55.856
I could approach it that way.

00:06:00.235 --> 00:06:01.595
Nice one, Min-gi.

00:06:01.678 --> 00:06:03.280
You sounded like a grown-up just now.

00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:07.267
I may not look it,

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.078
but I got into college
through an essay test.

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:12.664
Show me the whole application.
I'll take a look.

00:06:12.873 --> 00:06:14.374
Is that right? If so...

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:21.715
This one.
Tell me if this part sounds awkward.

00:06:21.932 --> 00:06:23.258
Let's see.

00:06:24.075 --> 00:06:27.679
Wait. You used the same word twice.

00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:30.515
Well, they're different words,
but they have the same meaning,

00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:32.684
so I think you can take one out.

00:06:43.428 --> 00:06:44.821
- Hey.
- Gi-hyeok!

00:06:57.834 --> 00:07:01.004
Look. They opened a huge Nike store.

00:07:04.916 --> 00:07:06.426
That coffee shop is so pretty.

00:07:08.328 --> 00:07:10.597
This neighborhood changed so much.

00:07:10.914 --> 00:07:12.390
Do you rarely come to this area?

00:07:12.741 --> 00:07:16.854
No, I don't. I mostly go
from my house to the bar and back.

00:07:17.504 --> 00:07:19.064
You know, this is my first time

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:21.119
going to the movies
since the whole school went

00:07:21.202 --> 00:07:22.234
when I was a high school senior.

00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:23.443
- Really?
- Yes.

00:07:28.073 --> 00:07:29.241
I'm so excited.

00:07:31.493 --> 00:07:33.895
- This popcorn is so tasty too.
- Yes.

00:07:35.617 --> 00:07:37.294
Do you feel more comfortable
with the armrest down?

00:07:37.377 --> 00:07:38.377
What?

00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:39.992
No, not really.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:49.803
Just relax.

00:07:50.412 --> 00:07:52.055
I am relaxed.

00:07:53.773 --> 00:07:55.041
You don't need to close your legs.

00:08:00.271 --> 00:08:01.340
Oh, right.

00:08:01.423 --> 00:08:05.026
A close friend of mine
recommended this movie.

00:08:05.109 --> 00:08:06.577
- Okay.
- But

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.073
they apparently shot the movie
with leftover reels

00:08:10.223 --> 00:08:12.408
from a different film production.

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:13.701
- Seriously?
- Yes.

00:08:14.158 --> 00:08:15.829
And that's why it's more fun.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.833
- That's why it's more fun?
- Yes, he says it's funny.

00:09:36.643 --> 00:09:40.038
What's up? I'm at Blue Monkeys.
Come hang out.

00:10:24.733 --> 00:10:27.044
Hey, you're Yeon-jeong!

00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:29.087
- Yes.
- I can't believe I met you here!

00:10:29.888 --> 00:10:31.298
Where's Chae-yeong?

00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:33.200
I don't know.

00:10:33.283 --> 00:10:34.843
- Did you come here alone?
- Yes.

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:36.094
I'm also here alone.

00:10:36.286 --> 00:10:37.929
Did you memorize
all the moves to this song?

00:10:38.246 --> 00:10:39.639
Sort of.

00:10:50.024 --> 00:10:51.442
And the next move!

00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:55.029
You know it, right?
You have to skip over my back!

00:12:30.024 --> 00:12:31.792
I've never actually seen
the Nike freeze before!

00:12:31.943 --> 00:12:34.159
How do you dance so well?
Do you take dance lessons?

00:12:34.243 --> 00:12:36.281
Sorry, but I have to go.

00:12:36.364 --> 00:12:37.507
What?

00:12:42.412 --> 00:12:43.680
Where are you going?

00:12:43.805 --> 00:12:46.725
I have to catch the last bus.

00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:48.059
But...

00:13:06.469 --> 00:13:07.745
Hey.

00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:10.540
- Where are you off to?
- To see Gyu-cheol.

00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:12.750
Are you happy?

00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:14.293
Of course, I am.

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:16.462
Good. Have a good date.

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:18.214
See you.

00:13:36.883 --> 00:13:38.883
So, we can't meet on Saturday?

00:13:38.966 --> 00:13:40.069
No.

00:13:40.261 --> 00:13:43.364
It's my dad's birthday,
so we're going on a family trip.

00:13:44.032 --> 00:13:45.283
To where?

00:13:46.726 --> 00:13:47.827
Gangneung.

00:13:49.896 --> 00:13:51.080
I see.

00:13:51.372 --> 00:13:54.542
Then, I'll just follow my friends
on their trip.

00:13:56.586 --> 00:13:59.088
You're going on a trip too?
That's good. Where?

00:13:59.422 --> 00:14:01.422
I don't know. I have to ask.

00:14:01.908 --> 00:14:03.593
Mi-yeon is supposed to pick.

00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:07.471
- Only the girls are going?
- Yes.

00:14:08.982 --> 00:14:10.584
That sounds risky.

00:14:10.667 --> 00:14:12.977
What if some guys flirt with you?

00:14:13.144 --> 00:14:14.312
Don't be silly.

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:17.690
Why aren't you wearing our matching ring?

00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:19.984
What?

00:14:21.744 --> 00:14:23.028
Right.

00:14:25.648 --> 00:14:26.808
Ta-da.

00:14:26.891 --> 00:14:29.268
I took it off for a second
to wash my face.

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:32.371
- But you promised to wear it every day.
- All right.

00:14:32.454 --> 00:14:34.415
I'll keep it on even when I wash my face.
Okay?

00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:37.168
I'll keep this on all day.

00:14:42.131 --> 00:14:45.134
I just got on the bus.
It'll take about 20 minutes.

00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:50.264
I should get going.
It's almost time for my tutoring job.

00:14:50.973 --> 00:14:53.434
You can go first. Good work today.

00:14:53.517 --> 00:14:54.810
I'll call you.

00:14:56.145 --> 00:14:57.438
Get home safely.

00:15:00.691 --> 00:15:01.942
Yes.

00:15:06.856 --> 00:15:08.449
- What did they say?
- Shush.

00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:14.121
Okay. I understand.

00:15:16.541 --> 00:15:17.625
Bye.

00:15:34.183 --> 00:15:35.976
I passed the first stage.

00:15:36.586 --> 00:15:37.854
They want me to come in for an interview.

00:15:38.062 --> 00:15:38.998
- Seriously?
- Seriously?

00:15:39.081 --> 00:15:40.081
Yes!

00:15:52.326 --> 00:15:54.078
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:16:03.671 --> 00:16:06.591
- Anyway, congratulations.
- Thanks for your help.

00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:09.425
I didn't do anything.

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:12.513
No, your corrections were a huge help.

00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:16.392
No, it was all you.
I only gave you a little nudge.

00:16:16.548 --> 00:16:18.686
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:32.198
Oh, gosh. How many bottles

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:34.285
did we drink?

00:16:36.771 --> 00:16:38.915
One, two...

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:43.335
Including this one,
I think it's eight bottles.

00:16:43.886 --> 00:16:45.129
But I only see seven.

00:16:45.591 --> 00:16:46.651
I got it wrong.

00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:50.927
You can seriously drink.

00:16:51.285 --> 00:16:53.888
No. I should

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:55.973
stop drinking now.

00:16:56.374 --> 00:16:58.559
- You're tired, aren't you?
- No.

00:16:59.168 --> 00:17:01.061
When I'm drunk,

00:17:02.538 --> 00:17:03.731
I turn into a lunatic.

00:17:06.025 --> 00:17:07.401
I'm a lunatic, even when I'm sober.

00:17:08.761 --> 00:17:09.904
Cheers!

00:17:13.524 --> 00:17:15.409
Oh, no, I dropped it.

00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:17.954
Cheers.

00:17:24.902 --> 00:17:26.086
Hold on.

00:17:26.846 --> 00:17:27.922
Wait.

00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:30.548
This is Chau Chau.

00:17:31.192 --> 00:17:32.468
What's that?

00:17:32.785 --> 00:17:34.970
You don't even know Chau Chau?

00:17:35.413 --> 00:17:38.458
This is a song by Deli Spice.

00:17:38.641 --> 00:17:41.335
Oh, that's the title of this song?

00:17:41.602 --> 00:17:43.602
I knew the song, of course.

00:17:43.796 --> 00:17:45.548
This is my favorite song.

00:17:45.631 --> 00:17:46.941
I love this song.

00:17:47.633 --> 00:17:49.860
- Do you?
- You should listen to it.

00:17:50.386 --> 00:17:51.488
Okay.

00:17:52.446 --> 00:17:54.823
This is where the guitar comes in!

00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:32.987
What was that?

00:18:34.305 --> 00:18:35.364
What?

00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:38.909
- This.
- What?

00:18:48.002 --> 00:18:49.462
Are we in a relationship now?

00:18:52.757 --> 00:18:55.802
You just kissed me.

00:18:58.387 --> 00:18:59.597
Well...

00:19:07.129 --> 00:19:08.480
Wait.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.150
Was that your first kiss?

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.529
Of course,
I've never had a girlfriend before.

00:19:18.641 --> 00:19:20.993
You've never kissed anyone
you weren't dating?

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.413
You can do that?

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:32.002
Well, that's not what I mean.

00:19:33.406 --> 00:19:35.450
- But...
- Hang on.

00:19:35.533 --> 00:19:38.261
Wait. Calm down.

00:19:38.344 --> 00:19:40.930
- We are dating, aren't we?
- Hang on.

00:19:41.747 --> 00:19:43.307
Give me a second.

00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:45.017
Wait.

00:19:47.503 --> 00:19:48.562
No.

00:19:50.339 --> 00:19:51.523
Do you

00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:53.484
want me to be your girlfriend?

00:19:53.734 --> 00:19:54.777
Yes.

00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:56.821
- Why?
- Because I like you.

00:19:59.573 --> 00:20:00.616
That's

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:02.701
all?

00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:08.499
Is that wrong?

00:20:11.877 --> 00:20:13.003
No.

00:20:15.673 --> 00:20:16.966
That's

00:20:17.725 --> 00:20:18.926
all you need.

00:20:24.081 --> 00:20:25.474
I like you too.

00:20:30.896 --> 00:20:32.106
Seol-ha.

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:34.230
Yes?

00:20:35.451 --> 00:20:37.611
Can we do that

00:20:38.946 --> 00:20:40.406
again?

00:22:03.347 --> 00:22:04.740
Seol-ha.

00:22:15.584 --> 00:22:16.877
You scared me.

00:22:26.929 --> 00:22:28.264
Wait.

00:22:30.483 --> 00:22:32.174
- Give me a kiss.
- Are you crazy?

00:22:32.258 --> 00:22:34.258
- Come on.
- No.

00:22:34.472 --> 00:22:36.005
We're in public.

00:22:36.088 --> 00:22:37.648
- Why?
- Come here.

00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:43.112
- One more kiss.
- Let's just go. There are people.

00:22:45.848 --> 00:22:47.283
- Happy?
- Wait.

00:22:47.391 --> 00:22:48.784
- One last kiss.
- Gosh.

00:22:53.898 --> 00:22:55.333
Come on.

00:23:28.307 --> 00:23:30.909
- You're crazy!
- Why?

00:23:31.352 --> 00:23:34.121
I know that older-younger couples
are trending now,

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:37.083
but he's only 20 years old.
I can't believe you.

00:23:37.883 --> 00:23:39.441
She's six years younger than you!

00:23:41.211 --> 00:23:43.547
You're usually not this impulsive.

00:23:44.173 --> 00:23:45.324
Talk to me.

00:23:45.407 --> 00:23:47.927
- Hurry!
- He makes me feel good.

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:49.178
- Run!
- What?

00:23:49.428 --> 00:23:51.181
- Seriously.
- I don't know what it is, but--

00:23:51.264 --> 00:23:53.697
Get in here, guys!

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:55.767
- Come inside. Seol-ha! Hold on.
- Yes?

00:23:55.851 --> 00:23:58.437
Get over here!

00:23:58.671 --> 00:24:02.441
Guys, listen carefully, all right?

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:06.445
Seol-ha, we are dating, right?

00:24:07.529 --> 00:24:08.647
Yes, we are.

00:24:10.057 --> 00:24:11.992
And you're not lying?
You're really dating him?

00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:14.328
Yes.

00:24:16.105 --> 00:24:17.707
So, did you kiss him too?

00:24:19.708 --> 00:24:21.460
- Guys.
- Are these your friends?

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:24.588
Yes, they're Gwang-jae,
Jun-seok, and Gi-hyeok.

00:24:25.089 --> 00:24:26.239
Hello.
- Hello.

00:24:26.322 --> 00:24:27.408
Hello.

00:24:27.491 --> 00:24:30.552
They won't believe that we're dating.

00:24:30.635 --> 00:24:33.514
They said they'd only believe me
if I showed them.

00:24:34.407 --> 00:24:35.641
No way!

00:24:37.351 --> 00:24:39.770
- Oh, my gosh.
- You're all wet. Where's your umbrella?

00:24:40.145 --> 00:24:42.145
We were playing Pump It Up. This is sweat.

00:24:42.231 --> 00:24:43.691
- Seol-ha.
- Right.

00:24:43.774 --> 00:24:44.858
Here.

00:24:45.901 --> 00:24:47.662
- Please drink these.
- It's lemonade.

00:24:47.838 --> 00:24:49.030
Yes, drink up.

00:24:49.113 --> 00:24:51.532
- Thank you.
- Thanks for the drink.

00:24:51.624 --> 00:24:53.325
- How much are they?
- Don't worry.

00:24:53.867 --> 00:24:55.077
Really?

00:24:55.344 --> 00:24:56.729
Thank you, Seol-ha.

00:24:56.812 --> 00:24:58.385
Can we call you that now?

00:24:58.469 --> 00:25:00.729
Not a chance. She's our sister-in-law now.

00:25:00.813 --> 00:25:02.960
- Sister-in-law.
- Dude.

00:25:03.302 --> 00:25:05.462
You can't call her that.

00:25:05.654 --> 00:25:06.964
At least not for a few years.

00:25:08.173 --> 00:25:09.839
Thank you for the lemonade, sister-in-law.

00:25:09.922 --> 00:25:11.218
Thank you.

00:25:12.244 --> 00:25:14.638
- The StarCraft game is starting soon.
- Oh, no.

00:25:15.581 --> 00:25:17.675
You're right. Look at the time.

00:25:17.758 --> 00:25:19.379
Bye now. Let's go.

00:25:19.463 --> 00:25:20.936
- Thanks for the drink.
- Hurry.

00:25:21.019 --> 00:25:23.647
- This is crazy!
- I still can't believe it.

00:25:27.818 --> 00:25:29.278
You still see him romantically?

00:25:30.446 --> 00:25:31.864
You know what I mean.

00:25:32.406 --> 00:25:34.366
All men are childish, anyway.

00:25:34.783 --> 00:25:36.201
I'll clear the tables.

00:25:55.746 --> 00:25:57.639
Sorry. You must have waited long.

00:25:57.824 --> 00:25:58.968
It's fine.

00:25:59.107 --> 00:26:00.986
I just got here from shopping.

00:26:02.653 --> 00:26:03.854
It's heavy.

00:26:05.878 --> 00:26:06.878
Here you go.

00:26:07.566 --> 00:26:08.650
What is it?

00:26:09.259 --> 00:26:11.486
I bought it while buying my makeup.

00:26:12.488 --> 00:26:13.656
Open it now.

00:26:24.658 --> 00:26:25.917
This is...

00:26:26.886 --> 00:26:28.212
too expensive.

00:26:28.862 --> 00:26:30.472
Just try it on.

00:26:30.823 --> 00:26:31.882
Okay?

00:26:32.917 --> 00:26:34.802
- Now.
- Okay.

00:26:41.391 --> 00:26:42.809
It suits you.

00:26:44.812 --> 00:26:46.063
But isn't this...

00:26:46.688 --> 00:26:48.398
like 300 to 400 dollars?

00:26:49.399 --> 00:26:51.860
You're ruining the mood.

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:56.530
But still...

00:26:57.099 --> 00:26:58.700
Is there anything you want?

00:26:59.451 --> 00:27:00.494
Me?

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:07.751
Roses?

00:27:09.044 --> 00:27:10.212
Roses?

00:27:10.385 --> 00:27:13.257
Yes. I've never gotten them before.

00:27:16.085 --> 00:27:18.085
I'm starving. Let's go.

00:27:18.178 --> 00:27:19.471
- Right.
- Yes.

00:27:25.144 --> 00:27:26.270
I'll carry it.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.480
I'm starving.

00:27:31.984 --> 00:27:33.319
Really?

00:27:33.552 --> 00:27:36.238
I could tell that you took lessons

00:27:36.321 --> 00:27:37.823
from the way you were dancing.

00:27:38.198 --> 00:27:40.617
Isn't Seongdeok Women's University
known for its dance club?

00:27:40.993 --> 00:27:43.996
Last month, they won first place
in the Street Dance Grand Championship

00:27:44.079 --> 00:27:46.165
- at Migliore, didn't they?
- Yes.

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:48.208
Did you participate too?

00:27:49.935 --> 00:27:52.046
Yes, I represent the freshmen members.

00:27:52.379 --> 00:27:55.048
Man, I knew it!

00:27:56.283 --> 00:27:58.635
Cool. So,

00:27:59.011 --> 00:28:00.387
what you were doing earlier

00:28:01.038 --> 00:28:03.766
is called locking, right?
You moved your hands like this.

00:28:04.041 --> 00:28:05.684
- Yes.
- Man.

00:28:06.159 --> 00:28:08.395
Can you teach me how to do that next time?

00:28:09.021 --> 00:28:10.348
- Sure.
- Do you mean it?

00:28:10.647 --> 00:28:12.647
I love hip-hop, you know.

00:28:15.027 --> 00:28:16.695
Really? Hip-hop music?

00:28:17.362 --> 00:28:18.789
Whatever it is.

00:28:19.031 --> 00:28:22.159
Music, dance, fashion, and everything.

00:28:24.461 --> 00:28:26.121
Do you have a favorite artist?

00:28:26.722 --> 00:28:27.722
Me?

00:28:27.956 --> 00:28:31.334
Tupac, Notorious B.I.G.,

00:28:31.527 --> 00:28:32.753
and...

00:28:33.337 --> 00:28:34.630
You know, all of them.

00:28:44.039 --> 00:28:45.390
You should listen to this one.

00:28:47.309 --> 00:28:48.352
Yes.

00:28:48.852 --> 00:28:50.062
It's Sisoo.

00:28:51.688 --> 00:28:53.148
Sisqó, actually.

00:28:54.091 --> 00:28:56.443
Oh, Sisqó. Man.

00:28:57.069 --> 00:28:58.137
Thanks for the CD.

00:28:58.654 --> 00:29:00.281
When did he release an album?

00:29:01.832 --> 00:29:03.492
- Be careful.
- What?

00:29:04.868 --> 00:29:05.869
Gosh.

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.997
- Isn't that a new shirt?
- I'll just wash it.

00:29:10.691 --> 00:29:12.042
I've always been clumsy.

00:29:12.918 --> 00:29:15.379
Anyway, thanks for the CD.

00:29:22.286 --> 00:29:24.263
Why were you staring at me just now?

00:29:25.372 --> 00:29:27.057
- Why?
- No reason.

00:29:28.892 --> 00:29:30.560
Why were you looking at me?

00:29:35.174 --> 00:29:36.317
Because I'm pretty?

00:29:37.259 --> 00:29:39.527
Well, yes.

00:29:41.471 --> 00:29:42.862
That makes me so happy.

00:29:44.474 --> 00:29:45.742
Cheers.

00:29:56.461 --> 00:29:57.963
Do you know why I'm pretty?

00:29:58.797 --> 00:30:00.048
What?

00:30:00.908 --> 00:30:02.343
It's because I'm mixed.

00:30:03.368 --> 00:30:04.636
My dad is

00:30:05.137 --> 00:30:06.597
Japanese, apparently.

00:30:06.997 --> 00:30:08.181
Oh,

00:30:09.291 --> 00:30:10.517
I see.

00:30:11.485 --> 00:30:13.937
But I've never actually seen him.

00:30:14.354 --> 00:30:16.815
What do you mean by that?

00:30:18.275 --> 00:30:20.694
Have you ever heard of a "local wife?"

00:30:22.632 --> 00:30:23.632
No.

00:30:25.073 --> 00:30:26.533
It's like a concubine.

00:30:27.342 --> 00:30:29.744
So, it's a second wife

00:30:30.062 --> 00:30:31.330
who lives in another country.

00:30:32.439 --> 00:30:33.957
My mom said she was one.

00:30:48.372 --> 00:30:50.724
Apparently, he was in the trading business

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:53.350
and used to travel back and forth
from Japan a lot.

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:55.603
And he was a customer
at where my mom was working.

00:30:57.005 --> 00:30:59.005
It's funny, isn't it?

00:31:01.485 --> 00:31:02.528
What is?

00:31:03.011 --> 00:31:04.154
You know,

00:31:05.113 --> 00:31:08.158
that happened to my mom
while she was working at a bar,

00:31:09.076 --> 00:31:11.078
and I'm doing the exact same thing.

00:31:17.459 --> 00:31:18.960
What you do for work now...

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:22.798
You can always quit.

00:31:26.285 --> 00:31:28.285
I wish I could,
but I've got a lot going on.

00:31:29.346 --> 00:31:31.598
And it's not like I have any other skills.

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:35.477
You can start studying again.

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.813
And go to college, you know.

00:31:53.829 --> 00:31:55.706
You should stop drinking now.

00:31:58.375 --> 00:32:00.961
You have no idea
how much liquor I can handle.

00:32:01.361 --> 00:32:04.756
I can even drink a whole bottle of whiskey
all by myself.

00:32:06.299 --> 00:32:08.676
I understand, so stop drinking.

00:32:09.177 --> 00:32:11.471
Have some water.

00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:14.433
Here.

00:32:14.933 --> 00:32:16.434
Seriously...

00:32:21.631 --> 00:32:23.483
You seem drunk.

00:32:23.566 --> 00:32:26.027
- Let's stop drinking.
- Don't!

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:29.990
I'm paying for this.
Can't you let me do what I want?

00:32:31.391 --> 00:32:32.450
What did you say?

00:32:36.746 --> 00:32:39.165
Yes, it was about time
you gave me that look.

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:41.502
The awfully disappointed look.

00:32:42.202 --> 00:32:44.003
You're...

00:32:45.338 --> 00:32:46.798
the same as everybody else.

00:32:49.951 --> 00:32:51.552
How about I disappoint you even more?

00:32:53.096 --> 00:32:55.849
I even had a sugar daddy
when I was in high school.

00:32:55.957 --> 00:32:58.977
- Stop it.
- I don't need you, so get out of my face.

00:33:14.559 --> 00:33:16.244
Choi Hui-seon, stop drinking.

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:17.563
Okay?

00:33:17.646 --> 00:33:19.206
Go away!

00:33:39.084 --> 00:33:40.352
Hui-seon.

00:33:44.022 --> 00:33:45.565
You think you're the only one
who's hurting?

00:33:45.941 --> 00:33:47.609
You're not the only one
going through a tough time.

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:50.486
Now what?

00:33:52.614 --> 00:33:54.157
My dad...

00:33:58.328 --> 00:33:59.563
killed himself.

00:34:07.796 --> 00:34:10.090
I came back home after his funeral,

00:34:11.633 --> 00:34:14.302
and everything in the house had
seizure tags on it.

00:34:16.663 --> 00:34:17.889
That day,

00:34:18.723 --> 00:34:20.723
there was a shower,

00:34:23.353 --> 00:34:25.605
and my mom and I were kicked out
without a single umbrella.

00:34:33.738 --> 00:34:35.031
Still,

00:34:36.725 --> 00:34:39.786
I'm clawing my way through
just to survive.

00:34:42.247 --> 00:34:43.623
Did you know that?

00:34:49.779 --> 00:34:51.631
To me, that kind of story...

00:34:53.266 --> 00:34:55.218
just sounds like you're bragging.

00:34:59.539 --> 00:35:01.975
I don't even know
how to claw my way through,

00:35:02.375 --> 00:35:04.102
nor do I have the energy to do so.

00:35:49.137 --> 00:35:50.317
Goodbye.

00:35:51.633 --> 00:35:53.633
Are you going to Busan to give a speech?

00:35:53.885 --> 00:35:56.654
A speech sounds too grand.

00:35:57.222 --> 00:36:00.000
I'm simply going as a profiler
to teach them

00:36:00.083 --> 00:36:03.119
about investigative techniques
and criminal psychology.

00:36:04.012 --> 00:36:07.254
You look fantastic in uniform.

00:36:07.337 --> 00:36:08.358
What?

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.126
- Do I?
- Yes.

00:36:12.696 --> 00:36:16.383
I don't know.
I just feel so uncomfortable in it.

00:36:18.326 --> 00:36:21.679
Anyway, look after the house
while I'm gone.

00:36:21.762 --> 00:36:23.306
- All right?
- Have a safe trip.

00:36:23.482 --> 00:36:25.235
You're coming
the day after tomorrow, right?

00:36:25.318 --> 00:36:26.476
In two nights?

00:36:38.346 --> 00:36:39.656
Something smells fishy.

00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:00.260
Why are you trying to verify
when your dad is coming home?

00:37:04.706 --> 00:37:06.516
- I did?
- Yes.

00:37:10.462 --> 00:37:12.856
Just because I'm gone...

00:37:15.925 --> 00:37:18.903
Don't cry
because you miss me so much, okay?

00:37:25.001 --> 00:37:26.160
Don't cry!

00:37:28.772 --> 00:37:31.958
Don't forget to give him
his birthday meal.

00:37:32.459 --> 00:37:35.345
I put the braised ribs and seaweed soup
in the refrigerator,

00:37:35.428 --> 00:37:36.822
so don't forget those, okay?

00:37:36.905 --> 00:37:38.905
I know. How many times
are you going to tell me?

00:37:38.988 --> 00:37:42.094
If she forgets, call me instantly.

00:37:42.177 --> 00:37:43.303
I will.

00:37:46.264 --> 00:37:49.142
- Happy early birthday.
- Thank you.

00:37:50.043 --> 00:37:51.269
Sweetheart.

00:37:52.896 --> 00:37:54.272
I'll be back, ma'am!

00:37:55.231 --> 00:37:56.774
- Have a safe trip!
- Yes, ma'am!

00:37:58.159 --> 00:37:59.527
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

00:37:59.928 --> 00:38:01.613
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

00:38:08.286 --> 00:38:09.496
Are you serious?

00:38:09.921 --> 00:38:11.080
I thought he was onto you.

00:38:11.372 --> 00:38:12.957
Some friend you are.

00:38:16.711 --> 00:38:18.963
Man, she's thrilled.

00:38:27.514 --> 00:38:29.349
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:38:30.667 --> 00:38:32.394
Help me with this!

00:38:32.685 --> 00:38:34.103
Coming!

00:38:39.734 --> 00:38:40.818
Hey, Ju-yeon.

00:38:43.596 --> 00:38:45.596
Are you guys evacuating or something?

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:47.200
Shut it.

00:38:51.855 --> 00:38:53.498
Wait, are those matching T-shirts?

00:38:53.998 --> 00:38:56.334
Look. They're pretty, right?

00:38:56.417 --> 00:38:59.295
Matching T-shirts,
matching bags, and matching sneakers.

00:39:00.363 --> 00:39:02.140
Gyu-cheol, be honest.
You don't like them, do you?

00:39:03.908 --> 00:39:05.593
What are you talking about? I love them.

00:39:05.869 --> 00:39:08.263
- It's just for today, though.
- Yes.

00:39:08.555 --> 00:39:09.973
Keep working hard.

00:39:12.892 --> 00:39:14.018
What?

00:39:15.979 --> 00:39:17.606
Ju-yeon, take a look.

00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:20.509
- Are we forgetting anything?
- Like what?

00:39:20.592 --> 00:39:21.985
- Yes.
- Let's see.

00:39:29.834 --> 00:39:31.953
I don't think so. No.

00:39:32.996 --> 00:39:34.915
- No, right?
- Of course not. We have everything.

00:39:35.148 --> 00:39:36.332
- Everything we need.
- Okay. Let's go.

00:39:47.218 --> 00:39:48.911
Right. You remember, right?

00:39:48.994 --> 00:39:51.055
Seaweed soup and braised ribs
in the refrigerator.

00:39:51.307 --> 00:39:53.850
- Yes. Go on.
- Make sure to eat those.

00:39:54.651 --> 00:39:56.978
SO YUN-CHANG

00:39:57.128 --> 00:39:58.546
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:40:02.286 --> 00:40:03.806
Wear your seatbelt.

00:40:04.177 --> 00:40:05.570
Drive safely.

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:07.321
- Okay.
- Bye.

00:40:08.973 --> 00:40:11.642
- Make sure to drive safely, okay?
- Braised ribs!

00:40:11.725 --> 00:40:13.035
Yes. Bye.

00:40:30.929 --> 00:40:33.640
It was so sunny this morning.
What happened to the weather?

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.853
Why? It's nice and atmospheric.

00:40:39.854 --> 00:40:42.565
Can we stop
by a panoramic arboretum today?

00:40:42.648 --> 00:40:45.026
- I hear they have a beautiful café.
- Sure.

00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:48.780
- Guide the way, ma'am.
- Yes.

00:40:49.164 --> 00:40:51.825
- Go straight,
- Okay.

00:40:52.116 --> 00:40:54.994
and when you see National Route 75,
take a right.

00:40:55.645 --> 00:40:59.374
Okay. Take a right at National Route 75.

00:41:00.066 --> 00:41:01.125
Let's go.

00:41:01.442 --> 00:41:02.835
Let's go.

00:41:05.838 --> 00:41:06.964
Ta-da!

00:41:08.383 --> 00:41:10.510
What do you think? Do I look young?

00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:12.595
Why does it look so awkward, though?

00:41:12.678 --> 00:41:14.764
Do you really have to go this far?

00:41:14.998 --> 00:41:18.143
I can't look too old.
I need to look young for him.

00:41:18.585 --> 00:41:19.976
You make things harder for yourself.

00:41:21.479 --> 00:41:22.814
Should I roll these down?

00:41:25.525 --> 00:41:26.901
He's really funny, you know.

00:41:27.427 --> 00:41:29.871
He tries to pay after we eat,

00:41:30.013 --> 00:41:33.366
and he takes the road side
when we're walking.

00:41:34.993 --> 00:41:36.328
He's adorable.

00:41:36.728 --> 00:41:40.761
Oh, boy. You're totally head over heels,

00:41:40.845 --> 00:41:42.124
aren't you?

00:41:42.959 --> 00:41:45.003
Are you sure this looks okay?

00:41:45.086 --> 00:41:46.629
You look pretty.

00:41:57.473 --> 00:41:59.183
So, my question was,

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:00.935
"Isn't Yun Seol-ha"

00:42:01.144 --> 00:42:04.189
"prettier than Kwon Seol-ha?"

00:42:06.507 --> 00:42:08.150
Who's Kwon Seol-ha?

00:42:11.213 --> 00:42:12.278
What?

00:42:12.655 --> 00:42:13.948
Kwon Seol-ha.

00:42:16.284 --> 00:42:19.787
- Well...
- I left the front gate open.

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:23.082
- The front gate is open?
- No, I closed it on my way in.

00:42:23.165 --> 00:42:25.376
- We'll go and check.
- But--

00:42:26.094 --> 00:42:27.170
I said I closed it.

00:42:27.804 --> 00:42:29.005
Jeez.

00:42:30.715 --> 00:42:31.883
They're nice, right?

00:42:46.072 --> 00:42:49.025
Guys, he's finished, right?

00:42:49.325 --> 00:42:51.861
I thought he was getting lucky for once.

00:42:55.181 --> 00:42:58.618
Shouldn't we go and stop her?
What if she's slapping him?

00:42:58.701 --> 00:43:01.162
He deserves every single slap.

00:43:08.528 --> 00:43:10.380
- Are we here?
- Yes, we're here.

00:43:10.947 --> 00:43:13.091
- How does it look?
- It's nice!

00:43:13.466 --> 00:43:14.842
- Is it?
- yes.

00:43:19.247 --> 00:43:21.624
- Here we are.
- Thanks for driving.

00:43:21.707 --> 00:43:23.017
It was nothing.

00:43:23.142 --> 00:43:24.769
- Watch out when you get out.
- Okay.

00:43:25.086 --> 00:43:28.606
- Here's your bag.
- Thanks.

00:43:35.622 --> 00:43:36.948
So, do you like it?

00:43:38.116 --> 00:43:39.200
It's prettier inside.

00:43:40.143 --> 00:43:43.037
- Okay.
- Let's head inside.

00:43:54.065 --> 00:43:56.117
So, I tried
looking for the gift certificate.

00:43:56.509 --> 00:43:59.637
I was going through the trash can
in front of all those people.

00:44:00.146 --> 00:44:02.223
Seriously.

00:44:02.306 --> 00:44:04.308
- I don't even want to think about it.
- You just didn't know.

00:44:04.391 --> 00:44:06.391
You're right. I didn't know anything.

00:44:06.794 --> 00:44:07.795
Hey!

00:44:07.908 --> 00:44:10.272
What took you guys so long?
Where have you been?

00:44:10.355 --> 00:44:12.066
You guys are so late.

00:44:12.275 --> 00:44:13.443
Wait.

00:44:16.387 --> 00:44:17.789
Are you okay? Did she hit you a lot?

00:44:17.872 --> 00:44:19.615
Dude!

00:44:20.475 --> 00:44:22.702
It's all right.

00:44:23.119 --> 00:44:25.955
Do you guys have any idea
how understanding she is?

00:44:26.706 --> 00:44:28.608
Seol-ha, are you sure you're okay?

00:44:28.692 --> 00:44:30.251
- Yes.
- Gosh.

00:44:30.662 --> 00:44:34.135
It's all good, right?
You understood everything, right?

00:44:34.219 --> 00:44:35.465
Keep your mouth shut.

00:44:36.324 --> 00:44:39.844
No, it's all water under the bridge.

00:44:40.386 --> 00:44:44.974
I got to be Min-gi's girlfriend,
thanks to the same name.

00:44:46.617 --> 00:44:47.935
Hear that?

00:44:48.277 --> 00:44:50.571
Did you guys hear that?

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.965
Why do you even date this guy?

00:44:53.048 --> 00:44:54.558
It's not too late to run away.

00:44:56.385 --> 00:44:58.737
- I'll run to the bathroom.
- Okay.

00:44:59.931 --> 00:45:01.366
Gosh.

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:03.760
Min-gi.

00:45:03.951 --> 00:45:05.411
Hold on to her.

00:45:05.494 --> 00:45:08.706
You'll never find a woman like her
again in your life.

00:45:11.943 --> 00:45:14.629
- Is that so?
- Stop playing.

00:45:15.504 --> 00:45:17.840
Anyway, we'll be on our way now.

00:45:18.116 --> 00:45:19.676
You're leaving? Why?

00:45:20.092 --> 00:45:21.911
We have a 3-on-3 group blind date.

00:45:22.562 --> 00:45:24.055
Gwang-jae got us one. Right?

00:45:24.531 --> 00:45:27.516
- Right?
- Yes. I did.

00:45:29.961 --> 00:45:32.272
- Let's go, Gi-hyeok.
- What? Right.

00:45:33.114 --> 00:45:34.398
We have a blind date.

00:45:37.135 --> 00:45:38.570
I'm coming home tomorrow.

00:45:38.928 --> 00:45:40.571
- Tomorrow? Why?
- You already know.

00:45:41.864 --> 00:45:42.948
What?

00:45:44.325 --> 00:45:45.451
Why?

00:45:49.689 --> 00:45:52.420
It's pouring out there.

00:45:52.503 --> 00:45:55.211
JU-YEON AND GYU-CHEOL'S
FIRST ANNIVERSARY

00:45:55.294 --> 00:45:56.337
It is.

00:46:03.244 --> 00:46:04.720
It smells so nice.

00:46:05.413 --> 00:46:06.472
Do you like them?

00:46:08.307 --> 00:46:10.017
I'll get you flowers more often.

00:46:10.893 --> 00:46:13.687
That's okay. Next time, give me cash.

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:17.650
Cash is good too.

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:23.405
I'll remove my makeup, so...

00:46:24.991 --> 00:46:26.034
you can shower first.

00:46:27.101 --> 00:46:30.271
Right. I'll take a thorough shower.

00:46:30.354 --> 00:46:31.664
Yes.

00:47:14.498 --> 00:47:15.958
Crap.

00:47:21.422 --> 00:47:22.673
Ju-yeon.

00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:27.553
What's this?

00:47:27.762 --> 00:47:29.847
What? What do you mean?

00:47:30.139 --> 00:47:31.223
"What do you mean?"

00:47:34.335 --> 00:47:35.478
Ju-yeon.

00:47:37.892 --> 00:47:40.483
- I can explain.
- How long has it been?

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:44.194
- Tell me the truth.
- I'm sorry, Ju-yeon.

00:47:45.304 --> 00:47:47.348
I've been meaning to tell you.

00:47:47.431 --> 00:47:48.699
How long has it been?

00:47:49.892 --> 00:47:51.785
- Two months.
- Two months?

00:47:53.871 --> 00:47:55.871
So, you've been lying to me all this time?

00:47:56.624 --> 00:47:58.376
I'm sorry.

00:47:58.943 --> 00:48:01.087
I've been meaning to tell you,

00:48:01.721 --> 00:48:05.132
but our first anniversary came up
while I was being indecisive.

00:48:05.908 --> 00:48:08.886
You were so thrilled
about this trip, you know.

00:48:10.179 --> 00:48:11.972
So, I didn't want to let you down.

00:48:13.541 --> 00:48:16.269
Does that mean you waited to tell me
until after our anniversary?

00:48:17.253 --> 00:48:19.105
While you lied to me the whole time?

00:48:21.482 --> 00:48:22.900
I'm so disappointed in you.

00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:26.946
What are you going to do?

00:48:27.738 --> 00:48:29.406
What are you going to do from now on?

00:48:31.367 --> 00:48:32.702
You don't want to tell me?

00:48:33.102 --> 00:48:34.412
Lee Gyu-cheol!

00:48:35.538 --> 00:48:37.957
I'm really sorry, Ju-yeon.

00:48:41.152 --> 00:48:42.336
But it's not...

00:48:42.862 --> 00:48:45.005
Do you have any idea
how bad this is for your body?

00:48:46.298 --> 00:48:48.298
This will give you lung cancer!

00:48:51.053 --> 00:48:52.096
Right.

00:48:52.972 --> 00:48:54.515
I promise I'll quit.

00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:00.354
I didn't smoke today, though.
Not yesterday either.

00:49:00.938 --> 00:49:04.024
- And I'm never going to smoke again.
- This is your last chance.

00:49:04.425 --> 00:49:08.195
Give me that. I'm not going to smoke.
It's terrible for my health.

00:49:08.278 --> 00:49:10.531
It's our first anniversary,
and this ruined the day.

00:49:15.211 --> 00:49:17.211
- And you don't have any more?
- No.

00:49:17.663 --> 00:49:19.665
This was going to be my last pack.

00:49:20.624 --> 00:49:22.751
It's just that it's harmful.

00:49:24.879 --> 00:49:25.922
You know...

00:49:30.593 --> 00:49:31.761
Ju-yeon.

00:49:32.845 --> 00:49:34.013
I'm sorry.

00:49:35.815 --> 00:49:37.058
Wait.

00:49:38.184 --> 00:49:39.477
Which one is the flower?

00:49:40.686 --> 00:49:42.396
I see a flower touching a flower.

00:49:45.274 --> 00:49:46.400
See?

00:49:47.151 --> 00:49:48.653
You're prettier when you smile.

00:49:50.237 --> 00:49:51.739
Keep smiling from now on.

00:49:54.492 --> 00:49:56.202
And thank you, Ju-yeon,

00:49:57.077 --> 00:49:58.370
for being understanding.

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:01.123
Whatever.

00:50:01.832 --> 00:50:02.958
Come here.

00:50:05.252 --> 00:50:07.045
- Thanks.
- But

00:50:07.713 --> 00:50:08.881
Gyu-cheol.

00:50:11.058 --> 00:50:12.217
It's too bright.

00:50:13.177 --> 00:50:15.177
Right. Give me a second.

00:50:21.518 --> 00:50:22.728
How about now?

00:50:38.036 --> 00:50:40.579
Gyu-cheol, how could you?

00:51:02.977 --> 00:51:04.977
I'm so jealous of Min-gi.

00:51:05.821 --> 00:51:06.855
Enough about him.

00:51:07.131 --> 00:51:09.900
Let's throw a proper birthday party
for Jun-seok now.

00:51:09.984 --> 00:51:11.569
There's no need.

00:51:11.653 --> 00:51:13.320
We all gathered and drank.
That's good enough.

00:51:14.029 --> 00:51:15.461
- Let's go to the PC café.
- What?

00:51:15.546 --> 00:51:16.756
- Sure.
- Hang on.

00:51:17.083 --> 00:51:20.019
We can't brush off a brother's birthday
like it doesn't matter.

00:51:20.102 --> 00:51:21.709
That should never happen,

00:51:21.792 --> 00:51:23.331
and I would have been so upset
if I were you.

00:51:24.123 --> 00:51:26.459
- So, what's your plan?
- In Gangnam,

00:51:26.542 --> 00:51:27.885
a new nightclub opened up.

00:51:27.968 --> 00:51:30.630
- Seriously?
- The girls are hot there.

00:51:30.713 --> 00:51:32.048
- Really?
- Hello?

00:51:32.715 --> 00:51:34.383
- Hey, Ju-yeon.
- If we bring Jun-seok...

00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:37.845
- Yes.
- Jun-seok.

00:51:38.488 --> 00:51:39.847
Yes?

00:51:41.065 --> 00:51:43.350
What do I do?

00:51:47.313 --> 00:51:48.564
Jun-seok!

00:51:48.964 --> 00:51:50.274
Where are you going?

00:51:50.799 --> 00:51:52.901
- What's the matter with him?
- I have no idea.

00:51:55.529 --> 00:51:57.823
Going to a nightclub without him...

00:51:59.141 --> 00:52:00.367
We'll wait for him there.

00:52:01.368 --> 00:52:03.245
- Where?
- The nightclub.

00:52:04.438 --> 00:52:05.497
What about the PC café?

00:52:06.623 --> 00:52:07.833
You said we were going to a nightclub.

00:52:13.948 --> 00:52:16.217
I don't think it'll work.
Let's go to the PC café.

00:52:18.677 --> 00:52:21.263
- But you said we were going!
- I'm not going.

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:28.979
Where are your friends?

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:31.106
Them?

00:52:32.483 --> 00:52:34.485
They suddenly have
a 3-on-3 group blind date.

00:52:38.947 --> 00:52:40.157
Just like that?

00:52:40.933 --> 00:52:42.284
Yes, just like that.

00:52:44.186 --> 00:52:45.746
- Gosh.
- I see.

00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:50.957
A blind date in the middle of the night?
- I know, right?

00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:52.419
They're so weird.

00:52:53.529 --> 00:52:54.880
It's getting late.

00:53:02.663 --> 00:53:05.432
No, it's not like that!

00:53:07.101 --> 00:53:08.561
Okay.

00:53:08.769 --> 00:53:10.145
Gosh.

00:53:14.508 --> 00:53:16.508
- It's raining.
- It is.

00:53:18.729 --> 00:53:21.240
Don't get rained on. Come here.

00:53:22.016 --> 00:53:23.909
What do I do?

00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:26.286
Stop crying.

00:53:28.522 --> 00:53:30.707
Calm down and tell me what happened.

00:53:32.084 --> 00:53:34.503
Gyu-cheol...

00:53:36.155 --> 00:53:37.631
Gyu-cheol...

00:53:39.158 --> 00:53:41.677
Gyu-cheol cheated on me.

00:53:45.289 --> 00:53:46.557
Where are you now?

00:53:47.708 --> 00:53:48.809
I'm...

00:53:50.018 --> 00:53:52.708
I'm in Gapyeong.

00:53:52.792 --> 00:53:54.231
Where in Gapyeong?

00:53:56.608 --> 00:53:58.485
It looks like a temple.

00:53:58.761 --> 00:54:00.821
Jun-seok, it's Cheonghak Temple.

00:54:01.596 --> 00:54:02.640
In Gapyeong.

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:05.159
Okay. I'm on my way there.

00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:08.662
Come on. Stop crying.

00:54:10.022 --> 00:54:11.874
Gyu-cheol...

00:54:13.609 --> 00:54:14.627
Hello?

00:54:15.085 --> 00:54:16.086
Jun-seok?

00:54:18.072 --> 00:54:19.757
Why can't I get a signal?

00:54:28.223 --> 00:54:30.350
Gyu-cheol, you bastard.

00:54:32.519 --> 00:54:35.439
Sir, please drive as fast as possible.

00:55:13.869 --> 00:55:14.987
It's working.

00:55:44.575 --> 00:55:46.010
Should we...

00:55:49.096 --> 00:55:50.681
go inside?

00:56:13.103 --> 00:56:14.454
You can sit here.

00:56:20.002 --> 00:56:22.129
- It's raining so hard all of a sudden.
- I know.

00:56:42.327 --> 00:56:44.150
Why don't you shower first?

00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:46.570
Okay.

00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:40.082
Min-gi, are you almost done?

00:57:41.541 --> 00:57:43.001
Yes, I'm coming out.

00:57:59.851 --> 00:58:02.062
- I'll take a shower too.
- Okay.

00:58:37.039 --> 00:58:38.182
Are you nervous?

00:58:39.917 --> 00:58:41.352
You're nervous, aren't you?

00:58:45.781 --> 00:58:46.982
It's okay.

00:59:26.753 --> 00:59:28.633
- Min-gi.
- Yes?

00:59:30.358 --> 00:59:32.360
Can you turn off the lights?

00:59:34.071 --> 00:59:35.990
Sure. I'll turn it off.

00:59:36.364 --> 00:59:37.782
I'll switch it off now.

01:00:28.650 --> 01:00:29.668
Min-gi.

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:48.812
You can rest your head down.

01:00:57.028 --> 01:00:58.363
Are you nervous?

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:01.950
No.

01:01:06.354 --> 01:01:10.667
They say that you won't feel nervous
when you close your eyes.

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:14.629
Okay.

01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:24.074
Can I ask you something?

01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:29.371
What is it?

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:34.000
Am I

01:02:34.526 --> 01:02:35.627
your first?
