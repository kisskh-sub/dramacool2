Out of eight billion people in the world

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.351
how likely is it
for your first love to work out?

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.398
First of all, there's
a 50-50 chance of love working out.

Then, the odds of being born
in Korea is one in 200.

the odds of being born

and meeting someone in your age group...

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:37.996

the chances of love working out

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.672
are closer to a miracle than fate

00:13:40.152 --> 00:13:43.155
[The field trip is canceled]

00:13:43.155 --> 00:13:45.699
Going down, going down!

00:13:51.747 --> 00:13:54.458
They've gone crazy.

00:13:54.458 --> 00:13:56.085
What's wrong with them?

00:13:58.003 --> 00:13:59.630
Hurry and get inside!

00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:01.924
What are you doing?

00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:03.926
What are you looking at?

00:14:04.635 --> 00:14:05.845
Can't you hear me?

00:14:09.223 --> 00:14:10.432
Hey!

00:14:10.432 --> 00:14:12.059
- Lee Ji-yoon!
- Hey!

00:14:12.434 --> 00:14:14.603
Everyone was sad that day

00:14:14.603 --> 00:14:16.397
- but Tae-woong wasn't.
- Come to your senses!

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:19.316
I really admired his free spirit.

00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:21.235
He just does whatever

00:14:21.235 --> 00:14:24.613
without caring about what other think
and I loved his confidence.

00:14:27.449 --> 00:14:29.243
I know everyone has their own type, but...

00:14:33.455 --> 00:14:36.333
Do you think this picture is cute too?

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:39.628
When'd you take this? He's so cute!

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:44.800
You have a sickness.

00:14:45.426 --> 00:14:47.011
A really bad one.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.306
Sunwoo, can't you send me that photo?

00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:52.808
- Ugh, that's a sickness. Let's go.
- Please?

00:15:04.278 --> 00:15:06.780
- Look at those two.
- They must be dating, wow...

00:15:06.822 --> 00:15:08.490
- Finally?
- They really must be dating.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:10.784
Why would someone as popular
and handsome as Sunwoo date her?

00:15:10.784 --> 00:15:11.869
No, he's mine!

00:15:11.869 --> 00:15:14.622
They're taking it the wrong way.
Don't walk so close to me.

00:15:14.622 --> 00:15:16.123
Don't worry.

00:15:16.123 --> 00:15:19.084
They're saying there's no reason
someone as handsome as me would date you.

00:15:19.418 --> 00:15:22.254
Still, keep your distance.
What if Woong misunderstands?

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:31.430
Lee Ji-yoon!

00:15:31.722 --> 00:15:33.515
I kind of got butterflies

00:15:33.515 --> 00:15:35.851
seeing you and Sunwoo together yesterday.

00:15:35.851 --> 00:15:37.978
I kind of got butterflies.

00:15:37.978 --> 00:15:40.147
It's not like that!

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:44.068
It's really not.

00:15:44.068 --> 00:15:45.611
You believe me Bong-hee, right?

00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:47.196
Yeah, I believe you

00:15:47.196 --> 00:15:50.032
so get along with Sunwoo
until we film the teaser, okay?

00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:52.952
Like they got along
during self-study last night?

00:15:54.244 --> 00:15:55.871
What is it?

00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:58.832
[Sunwoo sent 5,000 won]

00:15:58.832 --> 00:16:01.126
Secure some cream buns for lunch today.

00:16:01.126 --> 00:16:03.712
Cream buns, chocolate milk. Two of each.
Good luck!

00:16:03.712 --> 00:16:04.838
So annoying...

00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:09.551
Guys, look.
Where should this n go?

00:16:09.551 --> 00:16:11.136
It can move forward, right?

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.222
What do we get rid of under the ten?

00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:15.182
It's just ten.

00:16:15.766 --> 00:16:19.103
Log ten of ten is one, right? So...

00:16:20.562 --> 00:16:21.689
n...

00:16:21.689 --> 00:16:22.940
[Secure cream buns!]
You can write it this way.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.483
- Did you get that?
- Yes.

00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:26.151
- Answer me, please.
- Yes!

00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:27.945
Any questions?

00:16:35.786 --> 00:16:37.413
Bread!

00:16:37.413 --> 00:16:39.081
- Cream buns, cream buns.
- There's still a lot left!

00:16:42.876 --> 00:16:44.503
Three!

00:16:52.219 --> 00:16:55.055
What is this? Are you kidding me?

00:16:57.433 --> 00:16:58.892
Guys!

00:16:58.892 --> 00:17:01.145
Lee Ji-yoon likes Heo Tae-woong!

00:17:04.773 --> 00:17:06.859
- What?
- You like Heo Tae-woong?

00:17:11.947 --> 00:17:13.157
Be quiet!

00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:25.419
I don't like people
who are slow and frustrating like you.

00:17:36.138 --> 00:17:37.598
What a total slowpoke.

00:17:42.936 --> 00:17:44.021
Here.

00:17:45.481 --> 00:17:46.732
Where are you going?

00:17:47.399 --> 00:17:49.151
Stay with me until I eat.

00:17:49.359 --> 00:17:50.736
Why should I?

00:18:08.504 --> 00:18:11.340
I asked her to buy two
so we could eat them together.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.142
I hate Ha Sunwoo.

00:18:28.649 --> 00:18:30.651
What a total slowpoke.

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:42.371
I'm done holding back.

00:18:45.332 --> 00:18:49.044
The male lead gets bitten by a zombie
and his eyes turn red.

00:18:49.962 --> 00:18:51.922
He approaches the female lead

00:18:51.922 --> 00:18:54.258
and she yells at him to stay back

00:18:54.258 --> 00:18:56.385
smacking him with an empty lunch tray.

00:18:56.885 --> 00:18:59.972
But he keeps coming
so the female lead is furious.

00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:03.725
She slaps him with kimchi, doenjang

00:19:03.725 --> 00:19:05.686
cake, pepper

00:19:05.686 --> 00:19:08.021
and jjajangmyeon.

00:19:10.274 --> 00:19:12.109
Why'd it turn into
a slapping fest all of a sudden?

00:19:12.109 --> 00:19:14.319
She said she'll never work with you
if we don't change the script to this.

00:19:14.903 --> 00:19:17.531
So you need to talk to her.

00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:20.534
Man, what should I do?

00:19:22.369 --> 00:19:24.955
Ppo-ppo, I'm here.

00:19:25.747 --> 00:19:28.041
It feels good to see you.

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:32.212
I've been annoyed
because of this weird guy lately

00:19:32.754 --> 00:19:35.716
- and that's...
- Skipping practice, huh?

00:19:37.426 --> 00:19:38.760
You scared me.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.930
Lee Ji-yoon, we need to talk.

00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:46.268
I saw the script
and it was a slapping fest.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.146
I'm sorry.

00:19:49.688 --> 00:19:51.106
I won't make fun of you anymore.

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:53.567
So don't be mad at me, please?

00:19:54.276 --> 00:19:56.820
Liar, you're not gonna stop.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:58.488
No, I'm serious.

00:19:59.698 --> 00:20:02.618
And I'll help you with Woong too.

00:20:05.913 --> 00:20:07.706
Woong's into soccer-obsessed goddesses.

00:20:07.706 --> 00:20:09.291
I'll give you a crash course in soccer.

00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:11.752
I can't make you a goddess
but I can turn you into a soccer fan.

00:20:14.546 --> 00:20:15.964
Really?

00:20:15.964 --> 00:20:17.883
Of course!

00:20:19.509 --> 00:20:21.637
And I'll get rid of our contract, too.

00:20:24.223 --> 00:20:26.266
How can I trust you?

00:20:28.268 --> 00:20:30.729
I swear on Sam-sik's good name.

00:20:31.688 --> 00:20:33.065
Sam-sik?

00:20:37.444 --> 00:20:40.113
Oh, this was your father's clinic.

00:20:40.113 --> 00:20:41.573
Sam-sik!

00:20:41.573 --> 00:20:43.742
Dad's here, Sam-sik.

00:20:43.951 --> 00:20:47.246
Sam-sik, I can't believe
we finally get to meet.

00:20:47.246 --> 00:20:49.373
Sorry for calling you
Ppo-ppo all this time.

00:20:49.706 --> 00:20:52.751
Why is the name Sam-sik, though?

00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:55.045
They say the tackier the name
the longer they live.

00:20:55.796 --> 00:20:58.173
Last year on vacation
I rescued him by the beachside

00:20:58.382 --> 00:20:59.716
and he was in pretty bad shape.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.094
Is he okay now?

00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:04.346
Yeah, he's healthy.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.724
Sam-sik, you found yourself
a great owner, didn't you?

00:21:09.893 --> 00:21:12.771
Should we take a picture
to celebrate our first meeting?

00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:14.940
Take a picture of us.

00:21:17.276 --> 00:21:19.069
You're leaving me out?

00:21:20.779 --> 00:21:23.282
Alright, smile. Here I go.

00:21:23.699 --> 00:21:26.243
One, two, three!

00:21:27.869 --> 00:21:31.039
Okay, so this is
where the midfielder plays

00:21:31.039 --> 00:21:32.958
- and this is the winger's position.
- Winger.

00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:34.918
- This is the striker.
- Striker.

00:21:34.918 --> 00:21:36.670
Defender, goalkeeper.

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:41.508
- This time, say the positions too.
- The positions?

00:21:42.509 --> 00:21:44.303
One, two, three.

00:21:45.095 --> 00:21:46.388
So...

00:21:47.055 --> 00:21:49.349
- The winger?
- Nope.

00:21:50.183 --> 00:21:51.435
Midfielder.

00:21:51.727 --> 00:21:53.103
Memorize them again.

00:21:54.187 --> 00:21:57.190
Here, this is where the midfielders play.

00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:58.734
- Here and here.
- Okay.

00:21:58.734 --> 00:22:00.569
- This is where wingers play.
- Wing.

00:22:00.569 --> 00:22:01.695
You get it now, right?

00:22:01.695 --> 00:22:03.196
Alright, what's this?

00:22:03.655 --> 00:22:05.032
Midfielder?

00:22:05.449 --> 00:22:06.783
Ji-yoon.

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:08.535
Focus!

00:22:09.786 --> 00:22:12.539
You have to know these
to become a soccer fan.

00:22:12.539 --> 00:22:14.166
Alright, what's this?

00:22:14.916 --> 00:22:16.293
- Winger.
- Winger!

00:22:16.293 --> 00:22:18.462
- Then what about here?
- Midfielder.

00:22:18.462 --> 00:22:20.255
There you go! You get it now?

00:22:20.255 --> 00:22:22.632
Now, you have to memorize all of this.

00:22:22.966 --> 00:22:25.552
You gotta memorize all the tactics
to become a true soccer fan, okay?

00:22:27.971 --> 00:22:29.598
This goes here

00:22:29.973 --> 00:22:33.393
and this goes here from here...

00:22:33.727 --> 00:22:35.187
And this goes here.

00:22:43.403 --> 00:22:46.114
- Hey! What was that?
- Sorry.

00:22:46.114 --> 00:22:48.575
- I'll go get it.
- No, I'll go get it.

00:22:54.164 --> 00:22:55.290
Hey!

00:23:03.924 --> 00:23:05.258
Is that how you make it?

00:23:08.929 --> 00:23:10.931
It doesn't look too good, though.

00:23:18.939 --> 00:23:20.273
- You...
- Whoa!

00:23:20.273 --> 00:23:21.608
This is pretty good!

00:23:21.608 --> 00:23:23.068
Ha Sunwoo!

00:23:23.068 --> 00:23:24.486
- Give it back!
- It's so good!

00:23:26.405 --> 00:23:28.532
- Give it back!
- I don't want to!

00:23:29.116 --> 00:23:30.784
Give it back.

00:23:43.213 --> 00:23:44.673
But

00:23:45.006 --> 00:23:48.218
do you think this'll make Woong like me?

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:52.180
I've been meaning to ask you.

00:23:52.639 --> 00:23:54.433
Why are you so insecure?

00:23:55.475 --> 00:23:57.686
Who'd like someone like me?

00:23:58.019 --> 00:23:59.438
What's wrong with you?

00:24:00.355 --> 00:24:01.898
You said so too.

00:24:01.898 --> 00:24:03.942
You said I was a tall slowpoke.

00:24:04.317 --> 00:24:06.778
Hey, that was a joke.

00:24:07.028 --> 00:24:09.781
Your reactions are
pure gold when I tease you.

00:24:10.574 --> 00:24:12.033
How do you expect me to hold back?

00:24:12.033 --> 00:24:14.911
No, my mom said so too.

00:24:15.495 --> 00:24:18.540
She said compared to my sibling
who's quick and good at everything

00:24:19.166 --> 00:24:21.585
I'm slow and frustrating
and that it drives her nuts.

00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:24.838
She thinks I write because I'm bored, too.

00:24:25.589 --> 00:24:29.509
She said no one would read something
written by a clueless person like me...

00:24:32.012 --> 00:24:33.180
Lee Ji-yoon.

00:24:34.264 --> 00:24:36.141
Why don't you believe in yourself?

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.477
You're a great writer.

00:24:38.518 --> 00:24:40.896
You even wrote the play
for last year's festival.

00:24:43.315 --> 00:24:45.066
I was pretty moved back then.

00:24:47.694 --> 00:24:50.864
Why don't you write
a web novel and post it online?

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:53.533
I think people will love it!

00:24:54.075 --> 00:24:55.494
No way...

00:24:55.785 --> 00:24:58.288

Actually, Sunwoo helped me.

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:19.354
He taught me about soccer

00:41:58.057 --> 00:41:59.266
Yeah.

I didn't feel this way when I liked Woong.

What's wrong with me?

00:42:07.358 --> 00:42:09.109
Actually

00:42:09.485 --> 00:42:13.239
you seem the most like yourself
when you're with Sunwoo.

00:42:14.448 --> 00:42:17.201
That's why I hoped
you'd find someone like Sunwoo

00:42:17.201 --> 00:42:20.246
if you ever decided to start dating.

00:42:20.246 --> 00:42:23.457
I felt like you just
admired Woong like you do Sum Four.

00:42:26.877 --> 00:42:29.505
I think you need to
figure out how you feel first.

By the way, someone asked
if you had a girlfriend.

00:44:23.452 --> 00:44:25.746
It's obvious if you look at the Four Cut.

00:44:26.038 --> 00:44:27.581
I wonder why they asked.

00:44:29.208 --> 00:44:32.169

that first place is going goodbye, right?

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:34.838

He literally took a Four Cut
with his girlfriend, so why do you ask?

00:44:44.139 --> 00:44:46.058
I guess they're in denial.

00:55:43.214 --> 00:55:44.674
Yes, his little sister.

00:55:45.008 --> 00:55:47.093
Don't we look alike?

00:55:49.179 --> 00:55:51.264
He talks a great deal about you.

00:55:51.681 --> 00:55:53.350
Sunwoo does?

00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:56.644
Yeah, he said you're super funny and cute.

00:55:56.644 --> 00:55:59.397
I've never seen him
talk about girls before!

00:56:00.899 --> 00:56:03.234
- Oh my gosh!
- Oh my gosh!

00:56:04.736 --> 00:56:06.363
Here's your food.

00:56:06.404 --> 00:56:07.989
- Thank you.
- Sure.

00:56:09.074 --> 00:56:10.700
It was so nice to meet you.

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:13.661
- If we get the chance, see you next time!
- Sure.

00:56:16.915 --> 00:56:18.291
Guys...

00:56:18.291 --> 00:56:20.377
- Get out of here.
- Right now!

Tteokbokki's on me next time. Okay?

00:56:23.588 --> 00:56:24.798
You can do this!

00:56:24.798 --> 00:56:26.174

In that moment, Hee-soo felt

00:56:43.149 --> 00:56:44.609
a rush of heat inside.
You can do this!

I can do this!

00:56:45.693 --> 00:56:48.321
It took her a while to figure it out
but she finally understood.

00:56:48.655 --> 00:56:50.865
It was courage.

00:56:52.117 --> 00:56:54.494
If you like Ji-yoon, tell her.

00:56:54.494 --> 00:56:56.204
It was just a curiosity for me.

00:57:02.085 --> 00:57:05.004
Ji-yoon. It's Sunwoo.

00:57:06.339 --> 00:57:09.717
Your web novel is really good.
It's amazing.

Hey, Lee Ji-yoon!

00:58:35.762 --> 00:58:37.138
Sunwoo.

00:58:41.726 --> 00:58:43.895
I've been writing a web novel.

00:58:44.687 --> 00:58:45.939
I know.

00:58:46.189 --> 00:58:47.857
I don't like Woong.

00:58:49.776 --> 00:58:51.110
I know that too.

00:58:51.110 --> 00:58:54.239
Then do you know I like you?

00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:01.788
I got super jealous because
I thought your sister was your girlfriend

00:59:01.788 --> 00:59:05.291
and I was really hurt and sad
because you ignored me.

00:59:06.292 --> 00:59:10.004
So I ate a bunch of sweets
and gained three kilograms.

00:59:14.092 --> 00:59:15.635
So

00:59:16.177 --> 00:59:17.971
stop avoiding me.

00:59:19.264 --> 00:59:21.641
I had a really tough time, Sunwoo.

00:59:25.144 --> 00:59:26.854

00:59:27.397 --> 00:59:29.774
I thought I was gonna die.

When did you get so cheesy?

00:59:42.412 --> 00:59:44.038
So, should I not confess?

00:59:54.966 --> 00:59:57.135
To me, my first love

00:59:57.135 --> 00:59:59.679
wasn't the first person I liked.

00:59:59.679 --> 01:00:03.891
It's the person who made me
feel love for the first time.

01:00:20.033 --> 01:00:23.202
There's a Four Cut contest
for our school festival, so help me.

01:00:23.536 --> 01:00:25.788
Are you crazy?
Why would I take that with you?

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:28.666
I'll give you 50,000 won if we win.

01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:32.211
No, that's super cringey.

01:00:33.004 --> 01:00:36.049
Then I'll give you 10,000 won
of my allowance every month.

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:39.344
Really?
You can't change your mind later, okay?

01:00:39.344 --> 01:00:40.970
Of course not!

goes up in smoke?

I'll take care of it.

01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:07.825
That would make Jinho a criminal, though.
